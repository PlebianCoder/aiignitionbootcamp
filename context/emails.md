Hello Engineering Managers!


Engineering teams across various industries are racing to integrate AI into their workflows, yet unlocking its full potential requires more than just access to tools. While many of us are experimenting with AI, the absence of structured training and best practices can often limit its transformative impact. Using AI effectively to harness its productivity benefits requires intentional learning, practice, and refinement—without which teams risk inconsistent results and missed opportunities.


To address these challenges and empower our teams, the Developer Experience and Commerce Platform teams are hosting AI Ignition Bootcamps at our San Francisco, Toronto, and New York offices. This initiative is designed to close the gap between surface-level AI adoption and true mastery, equipping engineers with the skills, strategies, and hands-on experience they need to integrate AI deeply into their daily workflows.


Why Participate?


The AI Ignition Bootcamp is more than just a training session—it’s an investment. It provides:


Practical Learning: Attendees will gain hands-on experience with AI tools and tackle real-world scenarios, supported by expert Teaching Assistants.

Scalable Knowledge Sharing: The program leverages a “Teach One, Train Many” framework to ensure the value extends beyond attendees. Participants will graduate ready to lead micro-workshops and champion AI integration across their teams.

Real-World Application:  Attendees will work directly within their own codebases, applying AI techniques and tools to their current projects, ensuring the training has near-term demonstrable impact.

Impact-Driven Outcomes: By mastering AI workflows, engineers can drive faster feature delivery, improve efficiency, and foster innovation organization-wide.


Bootcamp Dates:

New York:  May 6 - May 8

Toronto: May 13 - May 15

San Francisco: May 20 - May 22


Nominate Culture Drivers


Each team can nominate two to three engineers to attend. These should be individuals who not only stand to benefit personally but who can also amplify their learning across the organization.


Participants will require pillar lead approval, and any travel required for participants outside office locations will be funded from the respective pillar’s travel and expense budget.


What Happens Post-Bootcamp?


Participants will be equipped to teach their teams with ready-to-use materials, such as curated playbooks, FAQs, and slide decks, as well as ongoing support via a collaborative Slack channel to share insights and address challenges.


This approach ensures the impact of the bootcamp scales, enabling consistent and actionable AI adoption across teams.


Submission and Deadlines


Submit your nominations by Apr 23, 2025. Selected participants and their managers will be notified by Apr 25, 2025. 


Space is limited, so act fast!


If you have any questions, please reach out to us in #ai-ignition-bootcamp.


Thanks,

Hello EM's!

A quick clarification for the registration process. 

You must register at one location for all of your nominees. For example, if I have 2 IC's Alex and Raed, they must be registered for only the Toronto bootcamp. I cannot register for both SF bootcamp for Alex and Toronto bootcamp for Raed.

Apologies for the confusion. 

Thank you!
Sam
