# Proposal: AI Ignition Bootcamp\n\n**DRIs:** Charan Mahesan Sam Kim\n\n## Unlocking the Potential of AI in Engineering\n\nEngineering teams across the industry are racing to integrate AI into their workflows, yet unlocking its full potential requires more than just access to tools. While many engineers are experimenting with AI, a lack of structured training and clear guidance can limit its transformative impact. Using AI effectively and taking full advantage of its productivity benefits is not automatic—like any skill, it requires intentional learning, practice, and refinement over time. Without this foundation, teams risk inconsistent results and missed opportunities.\n\nThe AI Ignition Bootcamp is a series of 3-day, in-person training workshops designed for the "Culture Drivers" of Instacart engineering (~180 engineers) to be equipped with AI skills and empower them to train their teams. This initiative bridges the gap between experimenting with AI tools and unlocking their full productivity potential, enabling consistent, impactful adoption across the organization. Its goal is to provide teams with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to seamlessly integrate AI into their day-to-day work. By doing so, the bootcamp serves to empower engineers at all levels to unlock AI's potential and amplify their impact across the organization. Not only does this initiative aim to create immediate value, but it also lays the groundwork for sustained innovation and growth in AI-driven engineering.\n\n## Why AI Ignition Bootcamp?\n\nWhile tools like Copilot and Cursor have provided engineers with a glimpse of AI's potential, true mastery remains a challenge. Unlike incremental improvements from past tools, agentic development represents a fundamental shift in how engineers think, plan, and execute their work. Without structured training, engineers may struggle to fully harness these tools, risking inconsistent adoption and missed opportunities to improve workflows.\n\nThe AI Ignition Bootcamp mitigates these risks by providing a structured, hands-on learning environment designed to empower engineers at every level. But more than just training, the bootcamp introduces a "Teach One, Train Many" framework to scale its impact. Participants graduate not only as skilled AI practitioners but also as torchbearers for their teams, equipped to multiply the program's value across the organization.\n\n## The Bootcamp\n\nThe bootcamp is built around the philosophy of "Teach One, Train Many." Participants are not just learners; they will be equipped to become AI advocates and educators within their teams. This ensures that the benefits of the program extend far beyond initial attendees and can influence engineering workflows at scale.\n\nKey elements of the program include:\n\n*   **Engaging, Hands-On Training:** Over three days, participants will explore foundational concepts of AI and practice integrating AI into real workflows. Training will include practical exercises in information gathering, planning, and implementation with AI copilots.\n*   **Participants as Multipliers:** Attendees will take on the role of torchbearers, sharing their learning with their teams in follow-up sessions. To support this, they will receive well-structured materials such as prepared slide decks, FAQs, and best-practice guides to run micro-workshops efficiently.\n*   **Opportunities to Iterate and Reflect:** Participants and their teams will have access to collaborative forums, such as a dedicated Slack channel, to address common questions, share insights, and refine approaches to AI practices.\n\nThrough these initiatives, the bootcamp creates not just skilled AI practitioners but also agents of change within teams, helping ensure the organization reaps the benefits of consistent and impactful AI integration.\n\n## Curriculum Overview\n\nThe program will run over three intensive days, including both expert-led presentations and interactive workshops. The sessions provide actionable, relevant strategies for integrating AI into workflows.\n\n*   **Day 1: Foundational Knowledge and Information Gathering**\n    Participants will build a foundational understanding of AI, begin to develop intuition when working with AI copilots, and practice using tools such as Cursor to gather actionable insights for their projects.\n*   **Day 2: Leveraging AI for Project Planning**\n    Participants will explore techniques for strategically incorporating AI into project planning. Case studies and real-world examples will highlight how to successfully use AI for efficient design and task sequencing. Practical exercises will allow participants to integrate these strategies with their real projects.\n*   **Day 3: Implementation and Problem-Solving**\n    The final day will focus on AI-driven coding, with participants learning techniques like constructing skeleton code, designing effective prompts, and segmenting and delegating tasks to AI copilots. Workshops will provide over-the-shoulder guidance as participants use Cursor to implement project workflows.\n\n## Outcomes & Measurement\n\n### Purpose and Measurement Philosophy\n\nOur measurement philosophy balances short-term goals with a clear vision for long-term transformation. We recognize that AI's full potential unfolds over time and cannot be fully captured by oversimplified metrics such as Lines of Code or isolated performance indicators. By adopting a nuanced approach that focuses on engagement, iteration, and productivity gains, we aim to highlight AI's transformative value while maintaining a commitment to sustainability and fairness in how we evaluate success.\n\n### Key Short-Term Success Indicators\n\nTo gauge the bootcamp's initial effectiveness, we will actively monitor key short-term metrics, including:\n\n*   **Qualitative Feedback via Surveys:** Before and after the bootcamp, participants will rate their confidence and effectiveness in using AI. This feedback offers direct insight into the program's immediate impact.\n*   **Increase in Weekly Active Usage of AI Tools:** We will track Agentic Usage rates of tools like Cursor and Gumloop to assess how quickly new AI-driven workflows are being adopted.\n*   **Knowledge-Sharing Sessions by Graduates:** We will measure how often bootcamp graduates lead training sessions, reflecting the multiplier effect of the "Teach One, Train Many" model.\n*   **Cursor Reject Trends:** By monitoring the frequency of manual intervention, such as rejections or rewritten prompts, we can gain insight into how participants refine and iterate with AI outputs.\n*   **More..** This is a continued work in progress, we'll work towards figuring out the right signals as we go.\n\nBy emphasizing these metrics, we can capture the program's immediate value in both skill development and organizational impact.\n\n### Sustained Growth and Long-Term Insight\n\nOver time, we will broaden our analysis to identify emerging patterns and the extended influence of the bootcamp. These contextual metrics, while not the primary focus initially, will help uncover long-term trends in AI-driven engineering:\n\n*   **Patterns in Pull Requests and Code Review Activity:** Monitor collaborative patterns with AI tools, such as the proportion of AI-assisted contributions or revisions accepted.\n*   **Token-Level Metrics (When Available):** Examine interaction data, such as input token volumes or prompt refactoring rates, to assess how engineers refine their AI queries over time.\n*   **Team-Level Impact:** Measure changes in overall team productivity and efficiency as bootcamp learnings are disseminated and adopted across teams.\n\nThis long-term focus ensures we respond to evolving needs and refine training approaches as necessary.\n\n### Aligning Expectations for Ongoing Adoption\n\nIt is challenging to isolate the bootcamp's direct effect on broader engineering output in the immediate term. However, by laying a strong foundation of skill and mindset, we anticipate measurable increases in productivity, AI adoption, and workflow efficiency over the next 1–2 quarters. As bootcamp graduates share knowledge within their teams, the broader workforce will gradually adopt more sophisticated AI practices, contributing to sustained innovation, incremental performance gains, and a culture of continuous learning.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve its understanding of how to measure AI's impact in software engineering, we will adapt our measurement strategies to align with emerging best practices and tools. By staying engaged with the broader industry's advancements and refining our methods accordingly, we aim to steadily enhance the accuracy and relevance of our measurements.\n\n## Logistics\n\n### Locations and Dates\n\n*   **New York**\n    *   Bootcamp Staff Onsite - 5/5\n    *   Bootcamp - 5/6 - 5/8\n*   **Toronto**\n    *   Bootcamp - 5/13 - 5/15\n*   **San Francisco**\n    *   Bootcamp - 5/20 - 5/22\n\n### Budget Proposal\n\n*   **Attendees:** 170 engineers * 25% travel rate * $2,200/pp = **$93,500** (~40 engineers traveling)\n*   **Social:** 191 engineers * $150 = **$28,650**\n*   **TAs (7):** 7 engineers * 2 cities visited * $2,200/pp = **$30,800**\n*   **Total Budget Approval: $152,950**\n\n*   Attendee budget and social ($122,150) would come from pillar-specific collaboration budget\n*   TA budget ($30,800) will require additional budget\n\n**Budget Estimation per Pillar DRI:**\n\n| Pillar DRI    | Attendee Estimation | Budget Estimation |\n| :------------ | :------------------ | :---------------- |\n| Adam Cohen    | 30                  | $21,500           |\n| Andy Chiu     | 21                  | $15,000           |\n| Lily Zhang    | 15                  | $11,000           |\n| Mahadev Konar | 18                  | $13,000           |\n| Pramod Adiddam| 49                  | $35,000           |\n| Siby Alappatt | 36                  | $26,000           |\n\n### Promotion & Communication\n\nWe request support from leadership in clearly communicating the value and expectations of these sessions to teams, ensuring strong registration and engagement.\n\n### Resource Commitment\n\nOrchestrating these large-scale, multi-city bootcamps will require significant investment to staff TA's appropriately.
