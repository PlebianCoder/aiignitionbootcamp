Hi team, just saw the latest email around teams needing to be in the same location. I am trying to gauge the reason for it. If the reason is primarily around similar set of problems OR similar codebase. The reason being is in 1 of my teams, we have backend as well as mobile, who live in separate locations (1 in SF and the other in Toronto). the codebase for the areas have no similarities. So was wanting to ask whats the primary reason for it

Thanks for raising the question 
@sumiran
Yes we are requiring teams to send 2-3 engineers to one location for the following reasons:
We envision the hands-on exercise as a pair programming session. This allows TA's to scale their support across ~10 engineers by reducing the projects to 5. (1:5 ratio)
One important outcome of these bootcamps is for these "culture drivers" to experience the bootcamp together and spread the learnings and the passion. By having groups, we minimize the risk of some engineers struggling alone or having a subpar experience.
An important factor in utilizing AI as copilots in software development is the need for engineers to provide contextual and expert feedback to the AI. Multiple engineers working on the same problem may be helpful for utilizing AI during the bootcamp more effectively.
Admittedly, we did not consider the scenario where a team has both mobile and BE engineers.
The curriculum will include utilizing AI for accelerating the ramp up of unknown codebase, planning a project around these codebases, and implementation.
It's up to the manager(s) to decide what would work best for their team(s), but it may be worthwhile to prepare a fullstack e2e project that a pair of mobile/BE engs will work on together to learn, plan, and execute during the bootcamp.

@Sung Kim (Sam) (Payments)

What do you mean by send 1?

Just one eng per team

The guidance is for there to be 2-3 people from each team learning and experiencing the bootcamp together and to partner with us on spreading the learnings.

I'm not sure what you're saying by "if it's BE heavy"

budgetary concerns on travel + making sure that the team hits on their OKRs is causing us be really really judicial with folks that we nominate. Therfore, for some teams, we can only spare 1 eng

What a realistic problem Sumiran lol
Unfortunately this will be up to the best judgement of the managers. We also have limited number of TA's. If you can pair with a sister team and work on the same project in your area during the bootcamp that might be a solution. (edited)

@Sung Kim (Sam) (Payments)
 do we already have budget approvals for eng travel or need to get those approved from our respective VPs?

per my understanding we need to get the approvals

Sounds like a really short notice to get confirmation from folks regarding travel and also get approvals.

@sumiran
 we have approvals for the overall budget and estimates for what that will work out to per pillar.
Managers should submit members of their teams that they think will be a good fit and are available to attend, and once we have a full set of nominees we will provide estimates to VPs of each pillar for them to approve the total spend.
hope that answers your question (edited) 
:thankyou:

is there a agenda for the 3 days bootcamp?  for people that need travel, should they plan to arrive a day before, and leave a day after  or last day afternoon?

Yes there will be a full packed curriculum and agenda, but we'll send out subsequent request for you to bring a real world problem to work on during the workshop sessions to apply the learnings to.
