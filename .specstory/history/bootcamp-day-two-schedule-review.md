Okay, I've reviewed the Day 2 schedule and curriculum (`schedule.md` and the relevant `day2_*.md` files) against the requirements in `bootcamp_requirements.md`.

Here's my analysis and proposed improvements:

**Compliance Check:**

*   **Duration (9 AM - 5 PM):** Met.
*   **Lunch (Start 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM):** **Not Met.** Current lunch is 12:15 PM - 1:00 PM.
*   **Hands-on Focus:** Partially Met. The afternoon has a large workshop, but the morning is lecture-heavy.
*   **TA Support:** Met (mentioned in workshop details).
*   **Session Lengths (30/45/60/90 min):** **Partially Met.** The main workshop is 105 minutes (14:15 - 16:00).

**Proposed Improvements:**

1.  **Fix Lunch Time:** Move lunch earlier to comply with the requirement. The easiest way is to shift the 11:30 AM talk to after lunch.
2.  **Adjust Workshop Duration:** Shorten the afternoon workshop from 105 minutes to 90 minutes to fit the standard block requirement.
3.  **Rebalance Schedule:** Adjust surrounding blocks (like the share-out session) slightly to accommodate the changes and maintain the 5 PM finish time.

**Proposed Day 2 Schedule:**

*   08:45 - 09:00 - Arrival / Coffee
*   09:00 - 09:30 - Recap & Opening (30 mins)
*   09:30 - 10:15 - [Talk: AI-Driven Planning, Unknowns â†’ Rough ERD](./curriculum/day2_talk_ai_driven_planning.md) (45 mins)
*   10:15 - 10:30 - Quick Break (15 mins)
*   10:30 - 11:30 - [Talk/Demo: Guiding the Planner â€“ Context & Feedback Loops](./curriculum/day2_talkdemo_guiding_planner.md) (60 mins)
*   **11:30 - 12:15 - Lunch (45 mins)** *<-- Moved earlier*
*   **12:15 - 13:00 - [Talk: Planning Across the Clarity Spectrum](./curriculum/day2_talk_planning_spectrum.md) (45 mins)** *<-- Moved after lunch*
*   13:00 - 14:00 - [Talk/Demo: Advanced AI Planning Patterns](./curriculum/day2_talkdemo_advanced_patterns.md) (60 mins)
*   14:00 - 14:15 - Break (15 mins)
*   **14:15 - 15:45 - [Planning Workshop: AI as Co-Designer](./curriculum/day2_workshop_planning.md) (90 mins)** *<-- Shortened*
*   **15:45 - 16:45 - Workshop Share-out & Discussion (60 mins)** *<-- Adjusted*
*   16:45 - 17:00 - Day 2 Wrap & Survey (15 mins)
*   18:00 - 19:30 - Optional Hack & Snack

This revised schedule now meets the lunch requirement and the session time constraints.

I will now update the `schedule.md` file and the relevant curriculum files (`day2_talk_planning_spectrum.md` and `day2_workshop_planning.md`) with these new times.

_**User**_

Do the same for Day 3

Okay, let's review the Day 3 schedule and curriculum.

First, I need to read the content of the Day 3 curriculum files.

Okay, I've reviewed the Day 3 schedule and curriculum files.

Here's the analysis against the requirements in `bootcamp_requirements.md`:

**Compliance Check:**

*   **Duration (9 AM - 5 PM):** **Not Met.** The current schedule ends at 3:00 PM (15:00).
*   **Lunch (Start 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM):** Met. Lunch is 11:45 AM - 12:30 PM.
*   **Hands-on Focus:** Met. There are three labs and several talks/demos.
*   **TA Support:** Met (mentioned in lab details).
*   **Session Lengths (30/45/60/90 min):** **Not Met.** Several sessions violate this:
    *   09:00â€“09:20 (20 mins) - LLM Refresh
    *   09:20â€“09:40 (20 mins) - Cursor Rules
    *   10:40â€“11:00 (20 mins) - AI Debugging Talk
    *   12:30â€“12:50 (20 mins) - Agents Mini-Talk
    *   13:45â€“14:10 (25 mins) - Peer Retro
    *   14:10â€“14:30 (20 mins) - Teach-Back

**Proposed Improvements:**

1.  **Consolidate Short Morning Talks:** Combine the "LLM Refresh" and "Cursor Rules" talks into a single 45-minute session (9:00-9:45). This fixes two non-standard slots.
2.  **Extend Debugging Talk:** Extend the "AI Debugging Talk" to 30 minutes (10:40-11:10), potentially incorporating more examples or a slightly longer walkthrough.
3.  **Adjust Debugging Lab:** Shift the "Debugging Lab" slightly later (11:10-11:55) and adjust its duration to 45 minutes.
4.  **Adjust Lunch:** Shift lunch to 11:55-12:40 (45 mins) to accommodate the morning changes.
5.  **Combine Agents Talk & Lab:** Merge the "Agents Mini-Talk" content into the beginning of the "Agent Mode Lab" and allocate 90 minutes for the combined session (12:40-14:10). This provides more hands-on time and removes another short slot.
6.  **Restructure Afternoon:**
    *   Remove the "Peer Retro" and "Teach-Back" sessions as distinct blocks. Integrate sharing opportunities within the labs or during the final wrap-up.
    *   Add a dedicated 30-minute break (14:10-14:40).
    *   Allocate 45 minutes for the Final Survey, Certificates, and Wrap-up (14:40-15:25). This is likely too short to reach 5 PM.
7.  **Fill Remaining Time:** To reach the 5 PM target, add another substantial block. A 90-minute "Open Lab / Project Work" session (15:25 - 16:55) where participants can apply learned concepts to their own projects or tackle advanced stretch goals from earlier labs would be beneficial. This heavily reinforces the hands-on requirement.
8.  **Final Wrap-up:** Adjust the final wrap-up to 16:55 - 17:00 (5 mins) for final remarks.

**Proposed Day 3 Schedule:**

*   08:45 - 09:00 - Arrival / Coffee (15 mins)
*   **09:00 - 09:45 - [LLM Refresh, Cursor Rules & Hygiene](./curriculum/day3_talk_cursor_rules_hygiene.md) (45 mins)** *<-- Combined & extended*
*   09:45 - 10:40 - [Lab: AI Implementation, Test-Driven](./curriculum/day3_lab_implementation_tdd.md) (55 mins -> Keep 60 mins: 9:40-10:40)
*   **10:40 - 11:10 - [Talk: AI Debugging with Logs and Screenshots](./curriculum/day3_talk_debugging_logs_screenshots.md) (30 mins)** *<-- Extended*
*   **11:10 - 11:55 - [Lab: Debug a Real (or Seeded) 500 Error](./curriculum/day3_lab_debug_500_error.md) (45 mins)** *<-- Shifted & adjusted*
*   **11:55 - 12:40 - Lunch (45 mins)** *<-- Shifted*
*   **12:40 - 14:10 - [Agents Intro & Lab: Try Agent Mode](./curriculum/day3_lab_agent_mode.md) (90 mins)** *<-- Combined talk & lab*
*   **14:10 - 14:40 - Break (30 mins)** *<-- Added break*
*   **14:40 - 16:55 - Open Lab / Project Work / Advanced Practice (135 mins -> Adjust to 135? No, keep 90 min blocks max. Split it maybe? Or make the previous lab longer? Let's try extending the Agent lab and adding a focused open lab)**
    *   *(Revision)*: Keep Agent Lab at 90 mins (12:40-14:10). Add Break (14:10-14:25 - 15 mins). Add 90 min Open Lab (14:25-15:55). Add Final Break (15:55-16:10 - 15 mins). Add Final Wrap-up/Survey/Certs (16:10-17:00 - 50 mins -> Adjust to 45 mins).

**Revised Proposed Day 3 Schedule:**

*   08:45 - 09:00 - Arrival / Coffee (15 mins)
*   **09:00 - 09:45 - [LLM Refresh, Cursor Rules & Hygiene](./curriculum/day3_talk_cursor_rules_hygiene.md) (45 mins)**
*   09:45 - 10:45 - [Lab: AI Implementation, Test-Driven](./curriculum/day3_lab_implementation_tdd.md) (60 mins)
*   **10:45 - 11:15 - [Talk: AI Debugging with Logs and Screenshots](./curriculum/day3_talk_debugging_logs_screenshots.md) (30 mins)**
*   **11:15 - 12:00 - [Lab: Debug a Real (or Seeded) 500 Error](./curriculum/day3_lab_debug_500_error.md) (45 mins)**
*   **12:00 - 12:45 - Lunch (45 mins)** *<-- Shifted slightly again*
*   **12:45 - 14:15 - [Agents Intro & Lab: Try Agent Mode](./curriculum/day3_lab_agent_mode.md) (90 mins)**
*   **14:15 - 14:30 - Break (15 mins)**
*   **14:30 - 16:00 - Open Lab / Project Work / Advanced Practice (90 mins)** *<-- Added Lab*
*   **16:00 - 16:15 - Break (15 mins)** *<-- Added Break*
*   **16:15 - 17:00 - Final Survey, Certificates, Wrap (45 mins)** *<-- Adjusted & moved*

This schedule now runs from 9 AM to 5 PM, meets the lunch requirement, has compliant session lengths, and includes significant hands-on time.

I will update the `schedule.md` file and the relevant curriculum files with these changes. I will also need to create a placeholder file for the new "Open Lab" session.

Reduce Workshop: "Map a Service You Don't Know" to 60 minutes on Day 1 and insert 60 minutes presentation/lab on documenting systems with AI

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I can make those changes to the Day 1 schedule.

1.  Reduce the "Map a Service You Don't Know" workshop to 60 minutes.
2.  Insert a new 60-minute Presentation/Lab session on "Documenting Systems with AI".
3.  Adjust the Day 1 schedule timings accordingly.

Here is the proposed updated Day 1 afternoon schedule:

*   13:00â€“14:00 â€” [Presentation: Effective Prompting Strategies](./curriculum/day1_prompt_strategies.md) (60 mins)
*   14:00â€“14:30 â€” [Navigator Pattern for Rapid Code Understanding](./curriculum/day1_navigator_pattern.md) (30 mins)
*   14:30â€“14:45 â€” Quick Break (15 mins)

*   **15:45â€“16:45 â€” [Workshop: "Map a Service You Don't Know"](./curriculum/day1_workshop_map_service.md) (60 mins)** *<-- Reduced & Shifted*
*   **16:45â€“17:00 â€” Day 1 Wrap-up & Survey (15 mins)** *<-- Shifted*

This maintains the flow and ends the day at 5 PM.

I will now update the `schedule.md` file, update the time in `day1_workshop_map_service.md`, and create the new curriculum file `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/day1_documentation_with_ai.md`.

Done. I have updated `schedule.md` for Day 1, adjusted the time in `day1_workshop_map_service.md`, and created the new curriculum file `day1_documentation_with_ai.md`.

---

_**User**_

Make Day 1 "Quick Break" 15->30 minutes and just call it a "Break". Don't shorten any sessions after that and go over. Make the last session 30 minutes not 15 minutes

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I understand. You want to extend the afternoon break on Day 1 to 30 minutes, rename it, keep the following session durations the same (which will push the end time later), and extend the final wrap-up session to 30 minutes. This will make the day end at 5:30 PM.

Here's the revised Day 1 afternoon schedule:

*   13:00â€“14:00 â€” [Presentation: Effective Prompting Strategies](./curriculum/day1_prompt_strategies.md) (60 mins)
*   14:00â€“14:30 â€” [Navigator Pattern for Rapid Code Understanding](./curriculum/day1_navigator_pattern.md) (30 mins)
*   **14:30â€“15:00 â€” Break (30 mins)** *<-- Extended & Renamed*
*   **15:00â€“16:00 â€” [Presentation/Lab: Documenting Systems with AI](./curriculum/day1_documentation_with_ai.md) (60 mins)** *<-- Shifted*
*   **16:00â€“17:00 â€” [Workshop: "Map a Service You Don't Know"](./curriculum/day1_workshop_map_service.md) (60 mins)** *<-- Shifted*
*   **17:00â€“17:30 â€” Day 1 Wrap-up & Survey (30 mins)** *<-- Shifted & Extended*

I will now update the `schedule.md` file to reflect these changes. No changes are needed in the individual curriculum files.

_**User**_

Mark everything as a.m. and p.m. 12 hour number instead of 24 hour

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I will convert all the times in `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md` to 12-hour format (e.g., 9:45 a.m., 1:00 p.m.).

First, I need to read the current content of the file.

_****_

I've updated all the times in `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md` to the 12-hour a.m./p.m. format.

---

_**User**_

Modify Day 2 to teach contents from @planningerd.md 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, this is a significant change. The `planningerd.md` document provides a deep dive into using Cursor for planning, covering context management, rules, intermediate files, task generation, workflows, and limitations.

Integrating this effectively into Day 2 means restructuring the day significantly to cover these practical, tool-focused aspects. I'll aim to replace or modify existing sessions to incorporate the key concepts from `planningerd.md`.

Here's a proposed restructuring of Day 2:

1.  **Merge/Modify Morning Context Talks:** The existing "AI-Driven Planning" and "Guiding the Planner" talks cover some basics. We'll consolidate and deepen these, explicitly incorporating `@-symbols`, Rules, Notepads, and context best practices from `planningerd.md` (Sections 2.1, 3, 4).
2.  **Replace Clarity Spectrum:** The "Planning Across the Clarity Spectrum" talk is more conceptual. We'll replace it with a more practical session focused on the iterative workflow using intermediate files (`plan.md`, `tasks.md`) and maybe Notepads as covered in `planningerd.md` (Section 5).
3.  **Refocus Advanced Patterns:** The "Advanced AI Planning Patterns" talk will be refocused specifically on **Generating Shovel-Ready Tasks**, incorporating the prompting strategies, templates, and examples from `planningerd.md` (Section 6).
4.  **Update Workshop:** The afternoon workshop will be explicitly framed around applying the full workflow discussed (context -> rules -> intermediate files -> task generation).
5.  **Add Limitations/Best Practices:** Add a brief session at the end covering the crucial limitations (context windows, reliability, security) and mitigation strategies from `planningerd.md` (Section 8).

**Proposed Day 2 Schedule (Incorporating `planningerd.md`):**

*   8:45 a.m. - 9:00 a.m. - Arrival / Coffee
*   9:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. - Recap & Opening (Introduce Day 2 focus on structured AI planning workflow)
*   **9:30 a.m. - 10:45 a.m. - [Talk/Demo: Effective Context for Planning (Rules, Notepads, @-Symbols)]** (75 mins -> Adjust to 60 mins: 9:30-10:30) *(Combines initial planning + context talk, adds Rules/Notepads intro based on `planningerd` Sec 2.1, 3, 4)*
*   **10:30 a.m. - 10:45 a.m. - Break** (15 mins)
*   **10:45 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. - [Talk/Demo: Iterative Planning with Intermediate Artifacts]** (45 mins) *(New session covering `planningerd` Sec 5 - using `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, Notepads for refinement)*
*   11:30 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. - Lunch
*   **12:15 p.m. - 1:15 p.m. - [Talk/Demo: Generating Shovel-Ready Tasks]** (60 mins) *(Refocused session based on `planningerd` Sec 6 - prompting strategies, acceptance criteria, templates)*
*   1:15 p.m. - 1:30 p.m. - Break
*   **1:30 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. - [Workshop: Applying the AI Planning Workflow]** (120 mins -> Adjust to 90 mins: 1:30-3:00) *(Updated workshop focus based on day's content)*
*   **3:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. - Workshop Share-out & Discussion** (60 mins) *(Focus on workflow, context use, task quality)*
*   **4:00 p.m. - 4:45 p.m. - [Talk: AI Planning Limitations & Best Practices]** (45 mins) *(New session covering `planningerd` Sec 8 - context windows, reliability, security)*
*   4:45 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. - Day 2 Wrap & Survey

*Self-Correction:* The initial timing went over. Let's adjust:
*   9:30-10:30 (60m) - Context Talk (Rules, @-Symbols)
*   10:30-10:45 (15m) - Break
*   10:45-11:30 (45m) - Iterative Planning / Intermediate Files
*   11:30-12:15 (45m) - Lunch
*   12:15-1:15 (60m) - Generating Shovel-Ready Tasks
*   1:15-1:30 (15m) - Break
*   1:30-3:00 (90m) - Workshop
*   3:00-3:45 (45m) - Share-out
*   3:45-4:00 (15m) - Break
*   4:00-4:45 (45m) - Limitations & Best Practices
*   4:45-5:00 (15m) - Wrap-up

This revised schedule fits within the 9-5 timeframe and incorporates the core practical elements of `planningerd.md`.

I will now:
1.  Read the latest `schedule.md`.
2.  Update `schedule.md` with the new Day 2 structure.
3.  Modify the existing Day 2 curriculum files (`day2_talk_ai_driven_planning.md`, `day2_talkdemo_guiding_planner.md`, `day2_talkdemo_advanced_patterns.md`, `day2_workshop_planning.md`) - likely needing significant content changes or replacement. It might be better to delete the old ones and create new ones based on the new structure.
4.  Delete `day2_talk_planning_spectrum.md`.
5.  Create new curriculum files for the new sessions.

Let's start by reading the schedule file again.

Okay, now I'll restructure Day 2 in the schedule file and delete the curriculum files that are being replaced or significantly changed. It's cleaner to create new ones for the new content.

+ # Day 2: Talk/Demo: Iterative Planning with Intermediate Artifacts
+ 
+ **Type:** Talk & Demo
+ 
+ **Time:** 10:45 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
+ 
+ **Goal:** Introduce workflows for iterative plan generation using intermediate files and Cursor features, based on `planningerd.md` Section 5.
+ 
+ **Key Concepts:**
+ *   **Why Iterate?** Plans evolve; AI isn't perfect first time.
+ *   **Intermediate Artifacts:**
+     *   Dedicated Plan Files (`plan.md`): Using a file as the persistent state of the plan. Demo: Generating initial plan, then refining a section using `@plan.md`.
+     *   Task Files (`tasks.md`): Separating detailed tasks from the main plan. Demo: Extracting tasks from `@plan.md` into `@tasks.md`.
+     *   State Management Files (`workflow_state.md`): Mention as advanced concept for agent workflows.
+     *   Notepads (Revisited): As storage for templates (e.g., task structure) or decisions made.
+ *   **Cursor Features for Iteration:**
+     *   Composer/Unified AI Interface (Cmd+I): Using checkpoints to roll back unsuccessful refinements.
+     *   Diff Views: Reviewing changes before applying.
+     *   Chat (Cmd+L) vs. Inline (Cmd+K): Choosing the right tool for different refinement tasks.
+ *   **Benefits:** Persistence, modularity, reviewability, better context management.
+ 
+ **Demo:** Walk through a short iterative cycle: Generate initial plan -> Refine 'API Design' section referencing `@plan.md` -> Extract tasks for 'API Design' into `tasks.md`.

+ 
+ **Goal:** Learn effective prompting strategies and techniques to generate detailed, actionable ("shovel-ready") tasks from a high-level plan, based on `planningerd.md` Section 6.
+ 
+ **Key Concepts:**
+ *   **What Makes a Task "Shovel-Ready"?** Specificity, clarity, actionability, testability.
+ *   **Task Decomposition Techniques:**
+     *   Explicit Generation Prompts: Directly asking for tasks from a plan section.
+     *   Sequential Decomposition: Interactively breaking down high-level steps.
+     *   Task Assessment/Subdivision (Mention): AI assessing difficulty to force granularity.
+ *   **Prompting Best Practices for Tasks:**
+     *   Be Specific & Unambiguous: Clear scope and outcomes.
+     *   Provide Necessary Context: Referencing `@plan.md#section`, `@specs.md`.
+     *   **Define Acceptance Criteria:** Crucial for defining "done". Demo asking for AC.
+     *   Request Estimation (Optional): Story points, T-shirt sizes.
+     *   Specify Format: Markdown list, JSON, required fields. Demo asking for specific format.
+     *   Focus on Action Verbs: "Implement", "Create", "Test".
+     *   Consider Dependencies: Prompting to identify task dependencies.
+ *   **Using Rules/Templates for Tasks:**
+     *   Demo: Using a Project Rule or Notepad (`@TaskTemplate`) to enforce a standard task structure (e.g., with fields for Assignee, AC, Estimate).
+ 
+ **Demo:** Taking a feature description from `@plan.md`, demonstrate different prompting strategies to generate tasks, including asking for specific formats and acceptance criteria. Show applying a rule/template for task generation.

+ 
+ **Activities:**
+ *   Participants choose a real backlog item or use a provided scenario.
+ *   **Phase 1: Setup & Initial Plan:**
+     *   Define/gather necessary context: `@Files` (code, PRD), `@Docs`, `@Notepads` (if created).
+     *   Define a simple Project Rule (e.g., task template or tech constraint - provide examples).
+     *   Prompt AI (Chat/Agent) to generate an initial high-level plan draft into `plan.md`, providing context and referencing the rule.
+ *   **Phase 2: Iterative Refinement:**
+     *   Review `plan.md`.
+     *   Select a section and prompt AI to refine it (using `@plan.md` reference), potentially using Composer/checkpoints.
+ *   **Phase 3: Task Generation:**
+     *   Prompt AI to decompose a refined plan section into shovel-ready tasks in `tasks.md`.
+     *   Specify requirements for tasks (e.g., acceptance criteria, format) in the prompt.
+     *   Review and manually refine generated tasks.
+ *   **Deliverable:**
+     *   `plan.md` (draft plan)

The schedule file `schedule.md` and the workshop curriculum file `day2_workshop_planning_workflow.md` have been updated. Day 2 now concludes at 5:30 p.m. with the extended workshop time.

---

_**User**_

Workshop should be the last thing before the day 2 wrap

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, understood. You want the workshop to be the last major session before the final wrap-up on Day 2. This means moving the "Limitations & Best Practices" talk and the "Workshop Share-out" around.

Here's the revised Day 2 afternoon/evening schedule:

*   11:30 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. - Lunch (45 mins)
*   12:15 p.m. - 1:15 p.m. - [Talk/Demo: Generating Shovel-Ready Tasks](./curriculum/day2_generating_tasks.md) (60 mins)
*   1:15 p.m. - 1:30 p.m. - Break (15 mins)

*   **5:15 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. - Day 2 Wrap & Survey (15 mins)**

This structure places the Limitations talk before the main workshop, then the workshop, a break, the share-out related to the workshop, and finally the wrap-up. The day still ends at 5:30 p.m.

I will now update the `schedule.md` file and the relevant curriculum files with the new times.

We don't need breaks on Day 2. Talk: AI-Driven Planning, Unknowns â†’ Rough ERD can be 60 minutes. 
Make lunch 12. Start at 10 a.m. Planning Workshop: AI as Co-Designer should be 2 hours

Okay, I will implement these changes for Day 2:
*   Start time moved to 10:00 a.m.
*   Remove all breaks.
*   Reintroduce a 60-minute "AI-Driven Planning, Unknowns â†’ Rough ERD" talk (likely replacing the "Iterative Planning" talk).
*   Lunch starts at 12:00 p.m. (assuming 45 minutes duration).
*   The workshop remains 120 minutes.

Here is the revised Day 2 schedule based on these requests:

*   **10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. - [Talk: AI-Driven Planning, Unknowns â†’ Rough ERD](./curriculum/day2_ai_driven_planning_intro.md) (60 mins)** *<-- New/Reintroduced*
*   **11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. - [Talk/Demo: Effective Context for Planning (Rules, @-Symbols, Notepads)](./curriculum/day2_context_for_planning.md) (60 mins)** *<-- Shifted*
*   **12:00 p.m. - 12:45 p.m. - Lunch (45 mins)** *<-- Starts at 12*
*   **12:45 p.m. - 1:45 p.m. - [Talk/Demo: Generating Shovel-Ready Tasks](./curriculum/day2_generating_tasks.md) (60 mins)**
*   **1:45 p.m. - 2:30 p.m. - [Talk: AI Planning Limitations & Best Practices](./curriculum/day2_limitations_best_practices.md) (45 mins)**
*   **2:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. - [Workshop: Applying the AI Planning Workflow](./curriculum/day2_workshop_planning_workflow.md) (120 mins)**
*   **4:30 p.m. - 5:15 p.m. - Workshop Share-out & Discussion (45 mins)**
*   **5:15 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. - Day 2 Wrap & Survey (15 mins)**

This schedule starts at 10:00 a.m., ends at 5:30 p.m., has no breaks, includes the requested talk, sets lunch at 12:00 p.m., and keeps the workshop at 120 minutes. The "Iterative Planning with Intermediate Artifacts" session has been replaced.

I will now:
1.  Update `schedule.md`.
2.  Delete the `day2_iterative_planning_artifacts.md` file.
3.  Create the new `day2_ai_driven_planning_intro.md` file.
4.  Update the times in the other affected Day 2 curriculum files.

+ # Day 2: Talk: AI-Driven Planning, Unknowns â†’ Rough ERD
+ 
+ **Type:** Talk
+ 
+ **Time:** 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.
+ 
+ **Goal:** Introduce the basic concepts of using AI in the early stages of project planning and design, focusing on identifying unknowns and generating initial data models.
+ 
+ **Key Concepts:**
+ *   **Basic AI Planning Loop:** Frame the problem -> Prompt AI -> Analyze output -> Refine prompt/plan -> Repeat.
+ *   **Instacart Apple Pay Story (Brief Mention):** Use case example illustrating how AI can help uncover requirements or potential issues early.
+ *   **Techniques for Early Planning / Exploration:**
+     *   **Identifying Unknowns:** Prompting AI with questions like "What information is missing?", "What assumptions are being made?", "What are the key dependencies?".
+     *   **Generating Rough ERDs:** Prompting AI to suggest a preliminary Entity-Relationship Diagram based on a high-level description of requirements (e.g., "Draft a simple ERD for a user profile system with posts and comments"). Focus on relationships and key attributes, not exhaustive detail.
+     *   **Brainstorming Approaches:** Using AI to explore different potential solutions or architectures at a high level.
+ 
+ **Emphasis:** AI as a brainstorming partner and tool to structure initial thoughts, requiring human validation and refinement. Connect this to the need for providing good context (covered next).
+ 
+ **Details:**
+ 
+ *(Add specific prompt examples for identifying unknowns and generating ERDs)*
