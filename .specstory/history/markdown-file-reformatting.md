Okay, I can help reformat the `schedule.md` file for better markdown structure and readability.

First, I need to read the entire file content.

Now I will reformat the `schedule.md` file. I'll remove the duplicate staff section, use consistent heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`), replace indented text with proper markdown lists (`*`), and add horizontal rules (`---`) between days.

I've reformatted the `schedule.md` file with standard markdown practices. The changes include:
*   Removing the duplicate "Staff" section.
*   Using `#` for the main title, `##` for major sections like "Staff", "Pre-Bootcamp Requirements", and "Day X", and `###` for time slots/session titles.
*   Converting indented descriptions into bulleted lists (`*`) with proper indentation for sub-items.
*   Adding horizontal rules (`---`) to separate the days visually.
*   Using inline code formatting (backticks) for things like `go test`, `@file`, `.cursorignore`, and `/v2/health`.

Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments!

+ # Payments AI Jam: Unlocking Productivity Gains for Engineers
+ 
+ **Author:** Alex Chow
+ 
+ ## Executive Summary
+ 
+ ### Overview
+ 
  The Payments team conducted a 4-day AI workshop to explore the use of AI tools in tackling complex engineering challenges, particularly integrating Braintree payments into Cashier, a historically time-intensive task. While AI demonstrated massive productivity gains, the workshop revealed a crucial insight: there is no silver bullet. The effectiveness of AI copilots is directly tied to the effort, practice, and expertise each engineer brings to mastering these tools and techniques.
- Key Results
- 5x Acceleration in Delivery Time: Reduced Braintree integration from a month+ to 4.5 days.
- 8x Faster Planning: Drafted integration plans in 2 hours instead of 2-3 days.
- 4-5x Onboarding Speed: Junior engineers ramped up independently in hours rather than days.
- Strategic Organizational Benefits
- Faster go-to-market for critical features.
- Engineering allocation optimization by reducing load on senior engineers.
- Key Discoveries
- No Passive Productivity Gains: Engineers achieved breakthroughs only after learning to:
- Craft effective prompts.
- Validate and refine AI outputs rigorously.
- Adapt workflows to align with AI strengths and weaknesses.
- The Clarity Spectrum Framework: Productivity gains increasingly improved when engineers moved tasks from exploratory uncertainty to well-defined implementation—using AI as a structured amplifier rather than an autonomous solution.
- Mastery Through Practice: Engineers who invested consistent effort in experimenting with and refining their AI workflows experienced exponential returns in speed and clarity over the course of the workshop.
- Challenges
- Hallucinations in Complex Work: AI produced plausible but incorrect solutions when operating in unfamiliar or ambiguous areas, highlighting the importance of human oversight and domain expertise.
- Learning Curve: Engineers unfamiliar with AI tools required practice to avoid pitfalls like polluted contexts, scope drift, and time-consuming error loops.
- Next Steps

+ 
+ ### Next Steps
+ 
  To scale these techniques across the organization:
- Empower Engineers: Build a culture where engineers continuously test and refine their AI skills as part of their daily workflow.
- Centralize Best Practices: Create a repository of tools, tips, and reproducible workflows to accelerate learning.
- Build Supporting Infrastructure: Optimize tools like Cursor with curated rules and context management to provide a firmer foundation for AI copilots.

+ 
+ ### Conclusion
+ 
  The AI workshop proved the transformative potential of AI copiloting, but it also underscored that meaningful productivity gains require deliberate practice, structured learning, and critical engagement from engineers. For organizations to fully realize AI's potential, they must empower individuals to evolve their skills, enabling AI to act as a true productivity multiplier rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
  
- The Challenge: AI in the Wild West of Legacy Code

+ 
+ ## The Challenge: AI in the Wild West of Legacy Code
+ 
  The Payments team gathered for a 4-day AI workshop—an intensive jam session designed to explore how AI tools could help us tackle our most complex engineering challenges. While the team was enthusiastic when we initially proposed the workshop, as the date approached, a healthy skepticism began to emerge.
+ 
  We'd had success using AI tools like Cursor in our smaller, cleaner Golang codebase for Cashier, but the legacy Ruby code? That sprawling, decade-old behemoth with its tangled dependencies?
  
  If we could crack the code on effectively using AI with our complex legacy systems, we could dramatically accelerate our productivity. So we set an ambitious goal: use AI to plan and then implement a real project across both the Ruby and Golang codebases, completely from scratch, and build our AI expertise through this experience.
- We imagined that our journey would reveal not just how to use AI tools, but when and why they succeed or fail in different situations. 
+ 
+ We imagined that our journey would reveal not just how to use AI tools, but *when* and *why* they succeed or fail in different situations.
+ 
  What we discovered through this process wasn't just a faster way to code—it was a fundamental transformation in how our team approaches complex engineering challenges.
-  
+ 
  Before diving into our workshop journey, let's take a moment to understand how these AI systems actually work. Having a basic mental model will help explain both the magic and the frustrations we encountered.
  
- Understanding AI Fundamentals: How LLMs Work
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Understanding AI Fundamentals: How LLMs Work
+ 
  If you're going to use AI effectively as a software engineer, it helps to have a basic understanding of how Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude or GPT actually work. Don't worry—this document won't dive into complex math or neural network architecture. Instead, let's build an intuitive understanding that will help explain both the strengths and limitations of these tools.
- Words as Directions in Space
+ 
+ ### Words as Directions in Space
+ 
  At their core, LLMs represent words as "vectors"—essentially arrows pointing in specific directions in a high-dimensional space. Think of each word as having a position in this space, where similar words cluster together.
+ 
  For example, in this simplified space:
  
- 
+ ```
+ [Diagram placeholder: Words like "bank" and "finance" point similarly, "river" differently]
+ ```
  
  Words like "bank" and "finance" point in somewhat similar directions because they're often used in similar contexts. Meanwhile, "river" points in a completely different direction.
+ 
  But here's where it gets interesting. Words can have multiple meanings, and the model doesn't store just one fixed direction for each word. Instead, it processes words based on their surrounding context.
- The Transformer: Updating Meanings Through Attention
+ 
+ ### The Transformer: Updating Meanings Through Attention
+ 
  The key innovation that powers modern LLMs is called the "transformer." Without getting technical, you can think of it as a program that allows words to "pay attention" to each other.
- When processing text, each word looks at all the other words and updates its meaning based on what's relevant. It's like each word asking, "Given all the other words around me, what should I really mean right now?"
+ 
+ When processing text, each word looks at all the other words and updates its meaning based on what's relevant. It's like each word asking, _"Given all the other words around me, what should I really mean right now?"_
+ 
  This "attention" mechanism is what allows LLMs to handle context so effectively. It's why they can understand that "bank" means different things in different sentences.
+ 
  When the model sees a sentence like "The boat reached the bank of the river," it shifts the meaning in a different direction:
+ 
+ ```
+ [Diagram placeholder: "bank" meaning shifted towards "river"]
+ ```
  
  This ability to dynamically adjust meaning based on context is what makes LLMs so powerful.
- Prediction Through Patterns
+ 
+ ### Prediction Through Patterns
+ 
  LLMs are trained by predicting what word comes next in billions of text examples. Through this process, they learn patterns:
- What words often appear together
- How meanings shift in different contexts
- Common structures in language
+ 
+ *   What words often appear together
+ *   How meanings shift in different contexts
+ *   Common structures in language
+ 
  When you ask an LLM a question, it's not retrieving a pre-written answer from a database. Instead, it's predicting what text would most likely follow your prompt based on all the patterns it learned during training.
- Why This Matters for Software Engineers
+ 
+ ### Why This Matters for Software Engineers
+ 
  Understanding these basics helps explain several behaviors you'll encounter:
- 1. Context Windows and Limitations
- LLMs can only "see" a certain amount of text at once (the context window). This is like the maximum number of words that can pay attention to each other at one time. When you hit this limit, the model drops context information.
- 2. Hallucinations and Confidence
- Since the model is always predicting what text is most likely to come next, it sometimes generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information. It has no built-in mechanism to distinguish between facts it's confident about versus patterns it's just guessing at—it's all prediction.
- 3. Pattern Recognition Strengths
- LLMs excel at recognizing and adapting patterns, which is why they're so good at tasks like:
- Explaining code in a different way
- Adapting existing code patterns to new contexts
- Translating between programming languages
- 4. The Importance of Prompting
- Your prompt creates the initial context that shapes how the model interprets everything that follows. This is why carefully crafted prompts yield better results—they establish clearer patterns for the model to follow.
- Sean’s LLM Foundations Presentation went into depth on many of these topics and more. It is highly recommended to browse through the slides!

+     *   Adapting existing code patterns to new contexts
+     *   Translating between programming languages
+ 4.  **The Importance of Prompting:**
+     Your prompt creates the initial context that shapes how the model interprets everything that follows. This is why carefully crafted prompts yield better results—they establish clearer patterns for the model to follow.

  With this basic understanding of how LLMs work, let's dive into our workshop experiences and see how these concepts played out in practice.

+ ## The Workshop Journey
+ 
+ ### Project Planning & Engineering Design: Navigating the Maze
+ 
  Our challenge was to create a comprehensive design document for migrating production traffic for Braintree—a payment service provider for PayPal, Venmo, and credit/debit cards—from the tangled legacy codebase into Cashier, our new Temporal-based money movement engine. The strategy? Start with a conversation. Rather than immediately asking Cursor to "figure it out," we focused on building a solid foundation—establishing a "ground truth" for how the system currently worked.
+ 
  The legacy code is notoriously convoluted—no clear modularity, poor separation of concerns, and implementations scattered across dozens of disconnected projects. It functions like a chaotic orchestra of webhooks, message queues, job handlers, and more, all woven together in complex and unpredictable ways.
- At first, Cursor impressed us. Within minutes, it identified connections that would have taken hours to untangle manually.

+ At first, Cursor impressed us. Within minutes, it identified connections that would have taken hours to untangle manually.
  
- But just as quickly, we encountered a major roadblock: dead code. Cursor became sidetracked by logic hidden behind inactive feature flags—code that was effectively turned off yet statically difficult to identify as such. It followed these paths, pulling in irrelevant files and creating a growing web of confusion. The model would even return to this dead code repeatedly, despite us explicitly pointing it out as irrelevant.
- This experience taught us a key lesson: sometimes it’s better to start fresh than to continue correcting a conversation that has gone off track. Once the model’s "memory" of the misstep was embedded in the conversation context, it became difficult to avoid revisiting the errors later, no matter how much we tried to redirect the model.
- This wasn’t just a minor annoyance—it significantly slowed our progress. We found ourselves repeatedly diverting time and focus to reset the AI’s path, preventing it from veering into irrelevant territory. However, during later implementation tasks, this problem’s impact was less pronounced, a discrepancy we eventually understood more clearly in hindsight.
- Implementation Planning: Unknown Unknowns and Hallucinations
- As we transitioned to creating an implementation plan, we encountered a significant challenge: the problem of "unknown unknowns."
- For example, Cursor confidently hallucinated a non-existent API for handling payment methods. Despite multiple corrections and attempts to clarify, the hallucination persisted in slightly modified forms.

+ 
+ As we transitioned to creating an implementation plan, we encountered a significant challenge: the problem of **"unknown unknowns."**
+ 
+ For example, Cursor confidently hallucinated a non-existent API for handling payment methods. Despite multiple corrections and attempts to clarify, the hallucination persisted in slightly modified forms.
  
- This highlighted a critical lesson: AI outputs should always be treated as drafts requiring validation, not as ready-to-use solutions. While AI can significantly accelerate the initial “homework” engineers need to complete before consulting domain experts, it cannot replace the need for that expert judgment.

+ This highlighted a critical lesson: **AI outputs should always be treated as drafts requiring validation, not as ready-to-use solutions.** While AI can significantly accelerate the initial "homework" engineers need to complete before consulting domain experts, it cannot replace the need for that expert judgment.
+ 
  Interestingly, these hallucinations occurred more often when working in areas we were less familiar with. The paradox was clear: AI is most likely to mislead when we lack the knowledge to verify its outputs. This made it even more important to establish strategies for mitigating these risks upfront.
- To address this, we decided to take a different approach while planning implementations for two payment processors: Braintree and Fiserv for EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer). Instead of starting from a blank slate, we gave Cursor a curated list of key file paths we had compiled earlier. Then, rather than asking for a plan in isolation, we prompted it to compare the EBT implementation against Stripe—a payment processor already implemented across both our Ruby legacy system and Golang-based Cashier system.

Instead of starting from a blank slate, we gave Cursor a curated list of key file paths we had compiled earlier. Then, rather than asking for a plan in isolation, we prompted it to **compare the EBT implementation against Stripe**—a payment processor already implemented across both our Ruby legacy system and Golang-based Cashier system.
+ 
+ The results were immediate and transformative. For example, while some engineers vaguely knew EBT used special "cancel/reversal" logic in lieu of refunds in some cases, they didn't know the specifics or where in the code this logic resided. Within seconds, Cursor identified all relevant files and described their behavior in detail—something that would have required hours of manual code exploration.

Within seconds, Cursor identified all relevant files and described their behavior in detail—something that would have required hours of manual code exploration.
  We found this approach successful for several key reasons:
- Concrete Context: By providing file paths, we reduced reliance on the AI to discover everything, narrowing the scope of the problem.
- Leveraging Pattern Recognition: Asking for comparisons (e.g., “How does EBT differ from Stripe?”) played directly to the AI's strengths in identifying and articulating patterns.
- Building on Existing Knowledge: Instead of expecting the AI to create new understanding from scratch, we anchored prompts in prior work, enabling more accurate and meaningful outputs.
- This experience underscored a critical insight: AI excels at extending and connecting knowledge, not inventing it. By anchoring our questions in detailed, real-world examples and asking for comparative insights, we were able to dramatically improve our understanding without falling into the hallucination trap.
- It also highlighted the importance of being deliberate and strategic in the questions you ask. For instance, "How does EBT work?" might yield a broad or hallucinated response, while "How does our EBT implementation differ from our Stripe implementation?" encourages the AI to focus on known systems and produce far more reliable insights.

+ 
+ ### Implementation: Keeping Focus in a Complex Codebase
+ 
  When we transitioned to implementation, we faced another significant challenge: keeping Cursor focused on the specific tasks within our vast and complex codebase.
+ 
  We had broken down the Braintree integration into well-defined, independent tasks, each assigned to different team members. However, Cursor had a tendency to go off track—making unrequested modifications to files assigned to others or attempting to implement features beyond the scope of the current task.
- As Raed aptly put it, "It's like asking someone to fix your kitchen sink, and they start remodeling your bathroom," after Cursor spontaneously began refactoring unrelated payment gateway code.

+ 
+ ```
+ [Image/Log placeholder: Cursor going off track]
+ ```
  
- The AI also occasionally fell into frustrating error loops. For example, Ryan spent nearly an hour trying to implement a webhook handler, but Cursor kept introducing new errors every time he attempted a correction with a slightly adjusted prompt. "I was trying to get the perfect prompt to generate exactly the right code," Ryan explained. We suggested an alternative: "Start by writing a skeleton with TODO comments and let Cursor fill in specific sections." He gave it a try, and the task worked seamlessly on the first attempt.

+ 
+ ```
+ [Image/Log placeholder: Error loop example]
+ ```
  
- Sara faced a similar issue while writing unit tests. Cursor consistently generated tests that failed because it didn’t truly grasp the underlying implementation. We encouraged her to take a different approach: "Write out the individual test scenarios in plain English first—define the cases we need to cover and explain why. Then type out the actual test structure manually and let Cursor handle the boilerplate code." This shift in strategy broke the impasse and allowed her to make rapid progress.

+ 
+ ```
+ [Image/Log placeholder: Unit testing issue]
+ ```
  
  Another critical revelation was how much better results were when starting fresh conversations with only the files directly relevant to the task at hand, rather than continuing from the broader context of our planning discussions. For narrowly scoped tasks, explicitly attaching the necessary files kept Cursor focused rather than relying on it to sift through an overwhelming codebase on its own.
+ 
  These observations connected clearly with our earlier experiences. When we had a precise idea of what we wanted to accomplish—when tasks were tightly scoped with clear boundaries—AI excelled. But in situations of ambiguity or exploration, it struggled to stay aligned and introduced errors. This reinforced the importance of framing our expectations and contexts with precision.
+ 
  Looking back through the lens of the Clarity Spectrum framework we later developed, these challenges made perfect sense. Even tasks on the "clearer" end of the spectrum still required scaffolding and deliberate guidance to keep the AI aligned. The more specific and well-structured our guidance, the more effectively the AI leveraged its strengths in pattern recognition, minimizing reliance on guesswork where mistakes tend to arise.
- Ultimately, we learned a key insight: AI tools aren’t autonomous implementers—they’re amplifiers of our understanding and intent. The sharper and more precise your vision, the more effectively AI can execute on that vision. Detailed, thoughtful inputs aren’t just helpful—they’re essential to unlocking AI’s true potential in implementation.

+ ## The Clarity Spectrum: A Key Discovery
+ 
+ Reflecting on our experiences after the workshop, we noticed a clear pattern in when AI excelled versus when it struggled. This led to the development of what we call the **"Clarity Spectrum"**—a mental framework that captures much of what we observed during the workshop.
+ 
  The Clarity Spectrum describes your position in understanding both the problem and the solution at any given stage.
+ 
+ ```
+ [Diagram placeholder: Clarity Spectrum (Left: Uncertainty, Middle: Emerging, Right: Clarity)]
+ ```
  
  Consider our journey with the Braintree integration throughout the week. At the start, everything was murky—we were deep in the fog, battling dead code that confused Cursor, encountering hallucinated APIs, and getting sidetracked by irrelevant or redundant files. By the end, however, we were efficiently implementing pieces of the solution, supported by well-defined tasks and clear expectations. The difference was stark: the same AI tool that felt unreliable on Monday was delivering accurate and valuable results by Thursday.
+ 
  Critically, this spectrum isn't unique to AI. It mirrors how engineers naturally approach problem-solving. However, recognizing where you are on this spectrum is essential to adjusting how you interact with AI in order to get the best results.
- Understanding the Spectrum
- Left Side: Exploratory Uncertainty
- Here, you're working in unexplored territory—perhaps diving into a part of the codebase you're unfamiliar with or exploring a new business domain. At this stage, you don't fully know what you're looking for or how to approach the problem.
- Middle: Emerging Clarity
- At this point, you've gathered some understanding and started identifying possible directions, but you're still exploring options and working through potential solutions. You have a general sense of what needs to happen but haven't locked down specifics yet.
- Right Side: Implementation Clarity
- On the far right, you have full clarity—both about the problem and the solution. You know exactly what needs to be done, so much so that you could write up a detailed ticket for another engineer to implement with little or no additional context.

- This explains the dramatic variation in our experiences with AI throughout the workshop. While exploring the payment system on the left side of the Clarity Spectrum, hallucinations weren’t just expected—they were a natural part of the learning process, helping surface areas that needed deeper investigation. In contrast, when we shifted to implementing specific components on the right side, precision became far more critical, and the tolerance for mistakes dropped significantly. Adjusting our approach to fit the stage we were in was essential to making effective use of AI.

Adjusting our approach to fit the stage we were in was essential to making effective use of AI.
+ 
+ ### The Journey Rightward
+ 
  A key takeaway from our workshop is that AI can significantly accelerate movement along the Clarity Spectrum—from uncertainty to clarity—but only when used appropriately at each stage.
- One critical realization was the existence of a "hallucination boundary," even in advanced tools like Cursor. This refers to the point where the AI stops finding relevant information and starts fabricating plausible-sounding but incorrect outputs. These hallucinations are particularly dangerous because they often appear convincing, making it easy to mistake "seemingly good artifacts" for "actually good artifacts," especially on the left side of the spectrum when clarity is low.

+ 
  This highlights why jumping straight from exploration to implementation is a misstep. The journey toward clarity needs deliberate validation steps, such as:
- Creating a document that maps out the system based on the AI's understanding.
- Reviewing key details with a second model to cross-check findings.
- Verifying critical points with domain experts to ensure accuracy.

+ *   Verifying critical points with domain experts to ensure accuracy.
+ 
  By taking these intermediate steps, you can avoid falling into the trap of over-relying on AI during exploratory stages and instead use it to effectively support your progression toward clarity.
- Hybrid Approaches for the Right Side
+ 
+ ### Hybrid Approaches for the Right Side
+ 
  Our implementation stories revealed another important insight about the right side of the spectrum. Even when you have clear requirements, sometimes the most effective approach isn't to have AI generate everything from scratch. Instead, a hybrid approach often works best:
- Providing skeleton code with TODOs, as we saw with the Braintree payment method implementation
- Breaking complex tasks into conceptual understanding followed by implementation, as with our unit testing approach
- Supplying concrete examples of patterns to adapt, rather than abstract descriptions

+ *   Breaking complex tasks into conceptual understanding followed by implementation, as with our unit testing approach
+ *   Supplying concrete examples of patterns to adapt, rather than abstract descriptions
+ 
  These approaches recognize that while you may have clarity about what needs to be done, guiding the AI with structure often produces better results than expecting it to generate everything perfectly in one shot.
- The Payoff: Speed Without Sacrifice
+ 
+ ### The Payoff: Speed Without Sacrifice
+ 
  When you align your approach with your position on the Clarity Spectrum, you get the best of both worlds: the speed of AI assistance without sacrificing quality or control.
+ 
  This framework explains why certain approaches worked well during our workshop while others led to frustration. It provides a lens through which we can understand the patterns of success and failure we experienced. While we didn't have this framework during the workshop itself, it emerged from reflecting on our experiences and explains the journey we intuitively navigated.
+ 
  The key insight is that AI isn't replacing your journey from uncertainty to clarity—it's accelerating it. And like any powerful accelerant, it needs to be applied thoughtfully at each stage of the process.
  
- Techniques That Emerged
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Techniques That Emerged
+ 
  During our week of experimentation, several powerful techniques emerged that significantly improved our ability to use AI effectively. These techniques helped us overcome challenges, minimize errors, and amplify AI's strengths.
- Context Shedding
+ 
+ ### Context Shedding
+ 
  As your understanding improves and you move rightward on the Clarity Spectrum, start fresh conversations to avoid "polluted context" from previous interactions. Letting go of earlier misconceptions ensures your current task stays focused and removes the risk of hallucinations from prior mistakes contaminating new outputs.
- Comparative Learning
- Use AI’s strength in pattern recognition by explicitly asking it to compare similar systems or implementations. For example, comparing EBT with Stripe unlocked valuable insights in minutes, showcasing how effectively this technique can clarify complex understanding.
- Manual Context Management

+ Use AI's strength in pattern recognition by explicitly asking it to compare similar systems or implementations. For example, comparing EBT with Stripe unlocked valuable insights in minutes, showcasing how effectively this technique can clarify complex understanding.
+ 
+ ### Manual Context Management
+ 
  For well-defined tasks, provide AI with only the relevant files instead of relying on it to search through the entire codebase. This keeps the AI centered on the task at hand and prevents it from being distracted by tangential or unrelated code.
- Iterative Refinement
+ 
+ ### Iterative Refinement
+ 
  View AI outputs as drafts, not final products. Use these drafts to speed up your exploratory work or "homework," but always validate results with domain experts before moving to implementation. Iterative refinement ensures higher-quality results.
- Strategic Backtracking & Hallucination Pre-emption
- When AI starts generating incorrect results, don’t just attempt to correct it after the fact. Instead, stop, backtrack, and refine your original prompt to guide the AI along a more accurate or focused path. Providing extra context or concrete examples can prevent hallucinations before they occur—especially critical when accuracy is paramount.
- Verification Through Translation

+ 
+ ### Verification Through Translation
+ 
  Before proceeding with implementation, ask the AI to explain its understanding in a different form, such as describing code in plain English. This forces the model to demonstrate comprehension, catching misunderstandings early and minimizing downstream mistakes.
- Model Characteristics Awareness
+ 
+ ### Model Characteristics Awareness

  Different AI models behave differently. For example:
- Claude 3.7 tends to “jump the gun” and fill in non-existent details to complete narratives.
- o1, o3-mini-high, and Deepseek R1 are better reasoning models, excelling at logic-heavy tasks.
- Multimodal models like GPT-4o can process screenshots of PRs, Jiras, or diagrams, accelerating the creation of effective inputs by reducing manual interpretation.

+ 
+ ### Quick Tips to Apply These Techniques Today
+ 
  Here are ten actionable steps you can use immediately to get better results from AI copilots:
- Start with conversation, not code generation
- Begin by asking the AI to explain relevant concepts or code rather than diving directly into implementation.
- Verify through translation
- Ask the AI to explain code in plain English before making changes to ensure it fully understands the task.
- Break down complex tasks
- Use multiple smaller, focused prompts instead of one big prompt, verifying progress at each step.
- Provide examples, not just descriptions
- Show the AI examples of the code patterns you want, rather than relying solely on abstract descriptions.
- Start fresh when stuck
- If the AI struggles to stay on track, start a new conversation with a clear and focused context rather than continuing to fix the same mistakes.
- Use strategic backtracking
- Refine your original prompt instead of repeatedly correcting misunderstandings. Setting clearer expectations up front can prevent recurring issues.
- Try the “explain then implement” pattern
- Have the AI clarify its approach before generating code. This ensures alignment and avoids wasted effort on misunderstood tasks.
- Leverage comparison prompts
- Ask questions like, “How does X compare to Y?” instead of “How does X work?” Comparisons often yield more contextual and nuanced insights.
- Create skeleton code yourself
- When dealing with complex tasks, sketch out the structure or skeleton of the code manually, and let the AI fill in the details or boilerplate.
- Explicitly manage context
- Use tools like .cursorignore to exclude irrelevant files or manually attach only the files you want the AI to reference. Controlling context avoids unrelated distractions.

+ 1.  **Start with conversation, not code generation:** Begin by asking the AI to explain relevant concepts or code rather than diving directly into implementation.
+ 2.  **Verify through translation:** Ask the AI to explain code in plain English before making changes to ensure it fully understands the task.
+ 3.  **Break down complex tasks:** Use multiple smaller, focused prompts instead of one big prompt, verifying progress at each step.
+ 4.  **Provide examples, not just descriptions:** Show the AI examples of the code patterns you want, rather than relying solely on abstract descriptions.
+ 5.  **Start fresh when stuck:** If the AI struggles to stay on track, start a new conversation with a clear and focused context rather than continuing to fix the same mistakes.
+ 6.  **Use strategic backtracking:** Refine your original prompt instead of repeatedly correcting misunderstandings. Setting clearer expectations up front can prevent recurring issues.
+ 7.  **Try the "explain then implement" pattern:** Have the AI clarify its approach before generating code. This ensures alignment and avoids wasted effort on misunderstood tasks.
+ 8.  **Leverage comparison prompts:** Ask questions like, _"How does X compare to Y?"_ instead of _"How does X work?"_ Comparisons often yield more contextual and nuanced insights.
+ 9.  **Create skeleton code yourself:** When dealing with complex tasks, sketch out the structure or skeleton of the code manually, and let the AI fill in the details or boilerplate.
+ 10. **Explicitly manage context:** Use tools like `.cursorignore` to exclude irrelevant files or manually attach only the files you want the AI to reference. Controlling context avoids unrelated distractions.

+ ## Results and Reflections
+ 
+ By the end of our four days, we hadn't completely finished the Braintree implementation—we deliberately chose to spend time building shared understanding rather than rushing to completion.
  
  But we had accomplished something perhaps more valuable: transforming how our team approaches complex work. We started with a group of engineers who had used AI primarily as "very smart code completion." We ended with a team confident in using AI across the entire development lifecycle—from initial exploration of unfamiliar code, through planning and design, to focused implementation.
+ 
  Most importantly, we proved that AI could be effective even with our most complex legacy systems. The key was understanding how to adapt our approach based on where we are on the Clarity Spectrum.
- "I used to think AI was only useful for simple tasks in clean codebases," one engineer told me on the final day. "Now I see it's actually most valuable in exactly the messy, complex situations I used to avoid using it for."
- For us engineers, the message is clear: AI can be effectively used even with complex legacy codebases. The learning curve is steep but short with proper guidance. And the benefits scale across different projects and teams.
- As Hengyu put it: "It's like we've all suddenly gained a superpower. The code hasn't changed, but our ability to navigate and understand it has transformed completely."
- 
- Tangible Results: Before & After
- Project Timeline Compression:
- Before: Braintree integration with Cashier (would have taken a month+)
- After: Completed in just 4.5 days (50% during the workshop, remainder completed 3 days later)
- Result: 5x acceleration in total delivery time
- Engineering Design & Planning:
- Before: Draft payment integration plan - EBT support in Casher (would have taken 2-3 days)
- After: First draft plan created in 2 hours
- Result: 8x acceleration in planning phase
- Code Exploration & Onboarding:
- Before: Junior engineers required days to understand unfamiliar code areas
- After: Achieved sufficient understanding in hours, with minimal senior guidance
- Result: 4-5x speed up in ramp-up time
- Design Review Preparation:
- Before: 5-6 days from planning to ERD review readiness
- After: Reviews scheduled just 2 days after workshop
- Result: 3x acceleration in design preparation
- Team Member Transformations
- The impact wasn't limited to the workshop—team members have continued to see dramatic improvements in their daily work
- Raed: "I've always made excuses to not use AI tools—thinking they wouldn't fit my workflow or questioning if they were worth the investment. But watching these tools used effectively during the workshop changed my perspective. The strategic backtracking technique was eye-opening—editing your previous prompt rather than trying to correct misunderstandings after they occur. And seeing someone go from zero context to 70% of a complete project plan so quickly was the kick I needed to incorporate these approaches into my daily work."
- Sara: "During the jam, I used AI to understand the Cashier codebase for our Alcohol project. What would have been a week of work took just 3 hours. Since then, I've been able to delegate complex tasks to our new hire Ryan that I previously would have handled myself. I just pointed him to the right prompting techniques, and he was able to navigate unfamiliar code independently."
- Sean:  "The AI Jam changed how I approach debugging complex issues. Recently, I encountered an overcapture authorization buffer problem that had me stuck for 30 minutes. I dumped the invoice data directly into Cursor and it immediately identified the issue—cutting what would have been at least an hour of investigation down to just 10 minutes. The ERD writing techniques were especially eye-opening. Seeing how AI could check our codebase, understand the differences between Cashier and legacy systems, and compare how EBT works differently from Stripe completely transformed my approach."
- Agustin: "I had to update charge logs in the admin app, which I expected would take 2-3 hours to ramp up on. Instead, I found the correct lines and had Cursor update them in just 30 minutes—a 6x improvement. In the past 1.5 weeks alone, I've saved about 3 hours by directly searching and navigating flows within Cursor instead of using GitHub's code search. The most valuable technique I learned was optimizing Cursor with rules tailored to our app, which dramatically increases the success rate of getting the right result on the first attempt."
- Ryan: "As someone who just joined, the AI techniques from the workshop have dramatically accelerated my onboarding. I was able to fix a bug in the charge plan that would have taken me 4 hours to understand on my own, but with AI assistance, I solved it in just 1 hour. The ability to summarize the codebase and create implementation plans for complicated tasks has been game-changing for me as a new team member."

I've reformatted `paymentsaijam.md`. I used `#` for the main title, `##` for major sections, and `###` for subsections. Lists are now proper markdown lists, emphasis is handled with bold (`**`) and italics (`_`), and I've added placeholders for where diagrams/images/logs might go using code blocks. Horizontal rules (`---`) separate major sections.

Next, I'll read `proposal.md`.

- Proposal: AI Ignition Bootcamp
- DRIs: Charan Mahesan Sam Kim
- Unlocking the Potential of AI in Engineering
- Engineering teams across the industry are racing to integrate AI into their workflows, yet unlocking its full potential requires more than just access to tools. While many engineers are experimenting with AI, a lack of structured training and clear guidance can limit its transformative impact. Using AI effectively and taking full advantage of its productivity benefits is not automatic—like any skill, it requires intentional learning, practice, and refinement over time. Without this foundation, teams risk inconsistent results and missed opportunities.
- The AI Ignition Bootcamp is a series of 3-day, in-person training workshops designed for the “Culture Drivers” of Instacart engineering (~180 engineers) to be equipped with AI skills and empower them to train their teams. This initiative bridges the gap between experimenting with AI tools and unlocking their full productivity potential, enabling consistent, impactful adoption across the organization. Its goal is to provide teams with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to seamlessly integrate AI into their day-to-day work. By doing so, the bootcamp serves to empower engineers at all levels to unlock AI’s potential and amplify their impact across the organization. Not only does this initiative aim to create immediate value, but it also lays the groundwork for sustained innovation and growth in AI-driven engineering.
- Why AI Ignition Bootcamp?
- While tools like Copilot and Cursor have provided engineers with a glimpse of AI's potential, true mastery remains a challenge. Unlike incremental improvements from past tools, agentic development represents a fundamental shift in how engineers think, plan, and execute their work. Without structured training, engineers may struggle to fully harness these tools, risking inconsistent adoption and missed opportunities to improve workflows.
- The AI Ignition Bootcamp mitigates these risks by providing a structured, hands-on learning environment designed to empower engineers at every level. But more than just training, the bootcamp introduces a “Teach One, Train Many” framework to scale its impact. Participants graduate not only as skilled AI practitioners but also as torchbearers for their teams, equipped to multiply the program’s value across the organization.
- The Bootcamp
- The bootcamp is built around the philosophy of “Teach One, Train Many.” Participants are not just learners; they will be equipped to become AI advocates and educators within their teams. This ensures that the benefits of the program extend far beyond initial attendees and can influence engineering workflows at scale.
- Key elements of the program include
- Engaging, Hands-On Training: Over three days, participants will explore foundational concepts of AI and practice integrating AI into real workflows. Training will include practical exercises in information gathering, planning, and implementation with AI copilots.
- Participants as Multipliers: Attendees will take on the role of torchbearers, sharing their learning with their teams in follow-up sessions. To support this, they will receive well-structured materials such as prepared slide decks, FAQs, and best-practice guides to run micro-workshops efficiently.
- Opportunities to Iterate and Reflect: Participants and their teams will have access to collaborative forums, such as a dedicated Slack channel, to address common questions, share insights, and refine approaches to AI practices.
- Through these initiatives, the bootcamp creates not just skilled AI practitioners but also agents of change within teams, helping ensure the organization reaps the benefits of consistent and impactful AI integration.
- 
- Curriculum Overview
- The program will run over three intensive days, including both expert-led presentations and interactive workshops. The sessions provide actionable, relevant strategies for integrating AI into workflows.
- Day 1: Foundational Knowledge and Information Gathering
- Participants will build a foundational understanding of AI, begin to develop intuition when working with AI copilots, and practice using tools such as Cursor to gather actionable insights for their projects.
- Day 2: Leveraging AI for Project Planning
- Participants will explore techniques for strategically incorporating AI into project planning. Case studies and real-world examples will highlight how to successfully use AI for efficient design and task sequencing. Practical exercises will allow participants to integrate these strategies with their real projects.
- Day 3: Implementation and Problem-Solving
- The final day will focus on AI-driven coding, with participants learning techniques like constructing skeleton code, designing effective prompts, and segmenting and delegating tasks to AI copilots. Workshops will provide over-the-shoulder guidance as participants use Cursor to implement project workflows.
- Outcomes & Measurement
- Purpose and Measurement Philosophy
- Our measurement philosophy balances short-term goals with a clear vision for long-term transformation. We recognize that AI’s full potential unfolds over time and cannot be fully captured by oversimplified metrics such as Lines of Code or isolated performance indicators. By adopting a nuanced approach that focuses on engagement, iteration, and productivity gains, we aim to highlight AI’s transformative value while maintaining a commitment to sustainability and fairness in how we evaluate success.
- Key Short-Term Success Indicators
- To gauge the bootcamp’s initial effectiveness, we will actively monitor key short-term metrics, including:
- Qualitative Feedback via Surveys: Before and after the bootcamp, participants will rate their confidence and effectiveness in using AI. This feedback offers direct insight into the program’s immediate impact.
- Increase in Weekly Active Usage of AI Tools: We will track Agentic Usage rates of tools like Cursor and Gumloop to assess how quickly new AI-driven workflows are being adopted.
- Knowledge-Sharing Sessions by Graduates: We will measure how often bootcamp graduates lead training sessions, reflecting the multiplier effect of the “Teach One, Train Many” model.
- Cursor Reject Trends: By monitoring the frequency of manual intervention, such as rejections or rewritten prompts, we can gain insight into how participants refine and iterate with AI outputs.
- More.. This is a continued work in progress, we’ll work towards figuring out the right signals as we go. 
- By emphasizing these metrics, we can capture the program’s immediate value in both skill development and organizational impact.
- Sustained Growth and Long-Term Insight
- Over time, we will broaden our analysis to identify emerging patterns and the extended influence of the bootcamp. These contextual metrics, while not the primary focus initially, will help uncover long-term trends in AI-driven engineering:
- Patterns in Pull Requests and Code Review Activity: Monitor collaborative patterns with AI tools, such as the proportion of AI-assisted contributions or revisions accepted.
- Token-Level Metrics (When Available): Examine interaction data, such as input token volumes or prompt refactoring rates, to assess how engineers refine their AI queries over time.
- Team-Level Impact: Measure changes in overall team productivity and efficiency as bootcamp learnings are disseminated and adopted across teams.
- This long-term focus ensures we respond to evolving needs and refine training approaches as necessary.
- Aligning Expectations for Ongoing Adoption
- It is challenging to isolate the bootcamp’s direct effect on broader engineering output in the immediate term. However, by laying a strong foundation of skill and mindset, we anticipate measurable increases in productivity, AI adoption, and workflow efficiency over the next 1–2 quarters. As bootcamp graduates share knowledge within their teams, the broader workforce will gradually adopt more sophisticated AI practices, contributing to sustained innovation, incremental performance gains, and a culture of continuous learning.
- As the industry continues to evolve its understanding of how to measure AI’s impact in software engineering, we will adapt our measurement strategies to align with emerging best practices and tools. By staying engaged with the broader industry’s advancements and refining our methods accordingly, we aim to steadily enhance the accuracy and relevance of our measurements.

- LLM Comparative Analysis for Software Engineering (Early 2025)1. Introduction: The LLM-Powered Developer Workflow in 2025OverviewThe landscape of software development is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the rapid integration and increasing sophistication of Large Language Models (LLMs).1 As of early 2025, these AI systems have evolved far beyond basic code completion tools. They are increasingly becoming integral partners in the development lifecycle, assisting with complex tasks such as debugging intricate issues, generating architectural suggestions, automating documentation, translating code across languages, and even participating in algorithmic problem-solving.1 This evolution is mirrored by the proliferation of AI-native Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and powerful extensions like Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, and the continuously enhanced GitHub Copilot, which aim to embed these capabilities directly into the developer's workflow.4Purpose & AudienceThis report serves as a practical guide and comparative analysis specifically designed for software engineers participating in the 'AI Ignition Bootcamp'. The primary objective is to equip engineers with a clear understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and practical trade-offs associated with the major LLMs prominent in early 2025. A particular focus is placed on the application of these models within common developer tools and workflows, especially environments like Cursor, which integrate multiple AI models [User Query]. The information presented aims to be actionable, enabling engineers to make informed decisions about which models to leverage for specific software engineering tasks.ScopeThe analysis encompasses leading LLM families from key providers actively shaping the AI landscape for developers: OpenAI, Google (via DeepMind), Anthropic, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Cohere [User Query]. The evaluation criteria include core technical specifications (modality, context window size, training data focus, API availability, cost structure), a detailed assessment of strengths and weaknesses pertinent to software development (code generation accuracy and complexity, code explanation, debugging, translation, algorithmic reasoning, technical design, speed/latency), and the relevance and integration of these models within developer tools, with a spotlight on Cursor [User Query]. The emphasis throughout is on practical utility and actionable knowledge for engineers adopting these technologies.2. Understanding the Landscape: Key LLM Providers and Models (Early 2025)Introduction to Major PlayersThe LLMs relevant to software development in early 2025 are primarily driven by a handful of influential organizations, each with distinct philosophies and model offerings:
- OpenAI: Known for its high-performance GPT series and the introduction of specialized "reasoning" models (o-series), often pushing state-of-the-art capabilities via proprietary APIs.8
- Google (DeepMind): Offers the Gemini family, characterized by strong multimodal capabilities, exceptionally large context windows, and the concept of "thinking models" accessible via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.10
- Anthropic: Focuses on developing capable and safe AI, emphasizing reliability, honesty, and reduced harmful outputs with its Claude models, often utilizing techniques like Constitutional AI.14
- Meta AI: A major proponent of open-weight models, releasing powerful Llama models (including the Llama 4 series with MoE architecture and multimodality) under permissive licenses, fostering community development.18
- Mistral AI: Another key player in the open-weight space, offering a range of models from highly efficient edge models (Ministral) to specialized code models (Codestral) and high-performance proprietary APIs via La Plateforme.21
- Cohere: Targets enterprise use cases, with models like Command A/R+ optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool use, multilingual business communication, and scalability.25
- Model Families OverviewThis report focuses on the following key models and families, selected for their state-of-the-art status or widespread use in software development contexts as of early 2025:
- OpenAI:
- 
- GPT-4.1 Series: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano 9
- o-Series: o3, o4-mini 8
- 
- 
- Google:
- 
- Gemini 2.5 Series: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash 10
- 
- 
- Anthropic:
- 
- Claude Series: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Haiku 14
- 
- 
- Meta:
- 
- Llama 4 Series: Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 4 Scout 18
- 
-

- 
- Mistral Large (latest), Codestral (latest), Ministral 8B 23
- 
- 
- Cohere:
- 
- Command Series: Command A, Command R+ 26
- 
- 
- Key Concepts for ComparisonTo effectively evaluate these models, understanding the following concepts is crucial:
- Modality: Refers to the types of data a model can process (input) and generate (output). Common modalities include text, code, images, audio, and video. Multimodal models can handle multiple types, enabling tasks like generating code from a diagram or explaining an image.18
- Context Window: The maximum amount of information (measured in tokens, roughly equivalent to word pieces) the model can consider at one time. Larger context windows allow models to process longer documents, entire codebases, or maintain conversation history more effectively.18 However, performance can sometimes degrade near the limit, and practical usage might be constrained by tools or cost.3
- Training Data Focus: Models can be trained on general web data or have specialized training on specific domains like code or scientific literature. This influences their proficiency in particular tasks.8 Some models are explicitly trained for "reasoning" or step-by-step problem-solving.8
- API Access & Cost Models: How developers access the model. Proprietary models typically offer APIs with per-token pricing, sometimes tiered based on usage or model capability.43 Open-weight models can be downloaded and self-hosted (requiring infrastructure management) or accessed via partner APIs.18
- Hallucinations: Instances where the model generates plausible but factually incorrect, nonsensical, or fabricated information.3 Reducing hallucinations is a key challenge, especially for complex reasoning tasks.
- Reasoning Capabilities: The model's ability to perform logical inference, multi-step problem-solving, planning, and critical analysis. Some models explicitly employ techniques like chain-of-thought or have dedicated "thinking" phases.8
- Tool Use / Agentic Behavior: The model's capacity to interact with external tools (like web search, code interpreters, databases, or custom APIs) to gather information or perform actions, enabling more complex, autonomous workflows.3
- IDE Integration: How readily and effectively a model integrates into developer environments like VS Code or specialized AI IDEs such as Cursor. This includes native support, availability through extensions (e.g., Copilot), or configuration via API keys.4
- 3. Comparative Analysis: LLMs for Software EngineeringThis section provides a detailed analysis of each major LLM provider and their relevant models as of early 2025, focusing on aspects critical to software engineering workflows.3.1 OpenAI: GPT-4.1 Series & o-SeriesOpenAI offers two distinct lines of advanced models relevant to developers: the GPT-4.1 series, focused on general capability and instruction following with large context, and the o-series, specialized for complex reasoning and tool use. Notably, the older GPT-4.5 Preview model is being deprecated in favor of the GPT-4.1 series.9
- 
- Models:
- 
- GPT-4.1 Series: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano 9
- o-Series: o3, o4-mini 8
- 
- 
- 
- Key Characteristics:
- 
- GPT-4.1 Series: These are multimodal models accepting text and image inputs to produce text outputs.29 They feature a significantly large 1 million token context window and a knowledge cutoff date of June 2024.9 Access is exclusively via the OpenAI API 35, with tiered per-token pricing: GPT-4.1 at $2.00/$8.00 (Input/Output per million tokens), mini at $0.40/$1.60, and nano at $0.10/$0.40.43 The series is designed as an upgrade over GPT-4o, emphasizing improved coding, instruction following, and long-context comprehension.9 The maximum output token limit for GPT-4.1 is 32,768.9
- o-Series (o3, o4-mini): These are designated "reasoning models," also multimodal with text/image input and text output.8 They possess a 200,000 token context window and a knowledge cutoff of May 31, 2024.29 Available via API, they command higher prices: o3 costs $10.00/$40.00 Mtok, while the smaller o4-mini costs $1.10/$4.40 Mtok.43 Their core design focuses on complex, multi-step reasoning and sophisticated, agentic use of tools like web search, Python execution, and image analysis.8
- 
- 
- 
- Pros for Software Development:
- 
- GPT-4.1 Series: GPT-4.1 demonstrates robust coding capabilities, achieving 54.6% on SWE-Bench Verified and significantly outperforming predecessors on code diff tasks, for which it was specifically trained.9 It shows marked improvement in frontend coding quality, preferred by human evaluators 80% of the time over GPT-4o, and makes fewer extraneous code edits.9 Its enhanced instruction following and large context window are beneficial for understanding and modifying large codebases or acting as part of an agentic system.9 The mini and nano variants offer viable alternatives where speed or cost are primary concerns, trading some capability for efficiency.9 GPT-4.1 also shows strong performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks like MRCR and Graphwalks.35
- o-Series (o3, o4-mini): These models represent the state-of-the-art in complex reasoning, applicable to challenging coding problems, algorithm design, and scientific computing tasks.8 o3 achieved SOTA results on Codeforces and SWE-bench (without custom scaffolding), while o4-mini shows strong coding performance, especially when utilizing its Python tool access.8 A key strength is their sophisticated, integrated tool use, allowing them to autonomously leverage web search, code execution, and other capabilities to solve problems.8 They also exhibit improved instruction following and generate more verifiable responses compared to earlier models.8 o4-mini provides a fast, cost-efficient option for high-throughput reasoning tasks.8
- 
- 
- 
- Cons/Limitations:
- 
- GPT-4.1 Series: Despite improvements, GPT-4.1 is still outperformed on some coding benchmarks (like SWE-Bench) by competitors such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro.37 There are indications that reliability might decrease when approaching the full 1 million token context limit, as suggested by OpenAI's internal tests.37 Its tendency towards literal instruction following means prompts must be carefully crafted and unambiguous.37 The June 2024 knowledge cutoff limits awareness of the very latest libraries or API changes.37 Some developers have reported struggles with specific complex tasks or frameworks compared to alternatives.63 Being API-only restricts casual experimentation compared to models available via chatbot interfaces.35
- o-Series (o3, o4-mini): A significant concern is the reported increase in hallucination rates. OpenAI's own PersonQA benchmark showed o3 hallucinating 33% and o4-mini 48% of the time, considerably higher than o1 (16%) and even non-reasoning models like GPT-4.5 (19%).42 This tendency might stem from the reasoning process generating more claims overall, both accurate and inaccurate.42 Users on developer forums have reported issues with "laziness," such as generating incomplete code snippets ("Paste the rest here") or shorter outputs than expected, particularly compared to older models like o3-mini-high.70 Some users perceive this as a downgrade for practical coding.70 There are also anecdotal reports of the models fabricating information or steps, especially when uncertain.51 The higher cost of o3 is also a factor.43 The models may also resist generating very long, repetitive outputs without strong prompting.67
- 
- 
- 
- Relevance/Integration (Cursor): The OpenAI models enjoy strong integration within Cursor. GPT-4.1 is natively available and offered for free to Cursor users.56 The o-series models (o3, o4-mini, o1, o1-mini, o3-mini) are also listed as available options, often recommended for use with Cursor's 'Agent' mode due to their tool-use capabilities.56 User feedback on GPT-4.1 within Cursor is generally positive for coding tasks, often described as precise, fast, and less prone to over-engineering compared to models like Claude 3.7.63 However, some limitations persist, such as difficulties with specific frameworks (e.g., Phoenix/Liveview) or generating very large code blocks.63 It's important to note that Cursor initially limits the context window for GPT-4.1 to around 128,000 tokens, not the full 1 million, pending further evaluation.72 The practical performance of the o-series models for coding within Cursor has received mixed feedback, aligning with the general user reports of potential "laziness" or incompleteness.69
- 
- 
- Understanding OpenAI's Strategy:
- 
- OpenAI's model lineup reveals a deliberate separation between general-purpose capability and specialized reasoning. The GPT-4.1 series aims for broad excellence in coding and instruction adherence, leveraging a massive context window 9, while the o-series pushes the boundaries of complex problem-solving and agentic tool use 8, accepting potential trade-offs like higher hallucination rates or variable output completeness.50 The distinct branding, pricing structures 43, and the replacement of GPT-4.5 with GPT-4.1 9 reinforce this strategic bifurcation. This necessitates a conscious choice by engineers: use GPT-4.1 for tasks benefiting from large context and reliable instruction following, or employ the o-series for deep reasoning and tool integration, while carefully managing their respective weaknesses.
- Benchmark successes, such as o3's performance on SWE-bench 8 or GPT-4.1's strength in code diffing 9, provide valuable reference points but do not guarantee universal superiority in real-world scenarios. User reports frequently highlight nuances and specific failures not captured by standardized tests, such as the o-series' reported "laziness" 70 or GPT-4.1's difficulties with certain frameworks.63 Furthermore, different hallucination benchmarks can yield conflicting results.50 Therefore, bootcamp participants should view benchmarks as directional indicators rather than absolute truths. Hands-on evaluation within their specific toolchains and workflows remains paramount for selecting the most suitable model.
- The increased sophistication of these models, particularly GPT-4.1's literal instruction following 37 and the o-series' complex reasoning pathways 8, demands more careful and precise prompt engineering. Reusing prompts designed for older, potentially more inferential models may lead to suboptimal results. OpenAI's release of a specific prompting guide for GPT-4.1 9 underscores this need. Engineers should expect to invest time in crafting specific instructions, potentially using structured approaches like prompted planning 35, and iterating based on observed model behavior.

- 
- 3.2 Google: Gemini 2.5 SeriesGoogle's Gemini 2.5 series, developed by DeepMind, represents their push towards highly capable, multimodal models with exceptionally large context windows and integrated reasoning capabilities.
- 
- Models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Preview/Experimental), Gemini 2.5 Flash (Preview).10
- 
- 
- Key Characteristics:
- 
- Common Features: Both models are natively multimodal, processing audio, image, video, and text inputs to generate text outputs.30 They feature a 1 million token context window (with 2 million planned for Pro) and share a January 2025 knowledge cutoff.12 Google designates them as "thinking models," capable of internal reasoning steps before producing a final response.10 Access is primarily through Google AI Studio (often with a free tier for experimentation) and Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform for production use.10 Pricing follows a tiered structure (Free/Paid) based on tokens, with variations for input types (audio is more expensive) and context size for Pro.44
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Positioned as the state-of-the-art model, excelling at complex reasoning across domains like coding, mathematics, and STEM. It's designed for analyzing large datasets, codebases, and documents leveraging its long context capabilities.11 Due to its preview status, it initially faced more restrictive API rate limits.30 Its cost is higher, particularly for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($1.25-$2.50 input / $10-$15 output per Mtok).44
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Optimized for a balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and low latency, making it suitable for high-volume tasks.10 Its defining feature is the controllable "thinking budget," allowing developers to set a token limit (0 to 24,576) for the reasoning phase, thus managing the trade-off between quality, cost, and speed.10 It offers a competitive price-performance ratio 10, with lower base costs ($0.15 input / $0.60 output Mtok) that increase significantly ($3.50 output Mtok) when the thinking budget is utilized.44
- 
- 
- 
- Pros for Software Development:
- 
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Offers top-tier coding performance, scoring 63.8% on SWE-Bench Verified with a custom agent setup, and excels in agentic coding, code transformation, and web app creation.12 The massive 1M token context window is a major advantage for understanding entire codebases (estimated around 30,000 lines), complex documentation, or multi-file projects.11 Its strong reasoning abilities are well-suited for complex algorithmic problem-solving, architectural design, and debugging.11 Native multimodality allows processing visual inputs like diagrams or UI mockups alongside code.11 It supports essential developer tools like web search, code execution, and function calling.11
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Provides a fast, low-latency, and cost-effective solution ideal for high-volume developer tasks like code completion, quick explanations, or simple generation.11 The controllable thinking budget offers unique flexibility; developers can disable thinking for maximum speed and lowest cost, or allocate a specific budget for moderately complex tasks, optimizing the quality/cost/latency balance.10 Despite being the 'lite' version, it maintains strong reasoning capabilities, ranking second only to 2.5 Pro on LMArena's Hard Prompts benchmark.10 It also supports tool use, including code execution and search.30 Its price-performance ratio is highlighted as a key strength.10
- 
- 
- 
- Cons/Limitations:
- 
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: As a preview/experimental model, it may exhibit instability or be subject to stricter rate limits than production models.30 Its cost is significantly higher than Flash, especially when utilizing the full context window.44 Some developers have reported occasional inconsistencies in generated code or a tendency to ask excessive clarifying questions, which could impede workflow.78 While highly capable in coding, it slightly lags behind Claude 3.7 Sonnet on certain specific coding benchmarks.78
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Naturally has a lower performance ceiling compared to 2.5 Pro, making it less suitable for the most demanding coding or reasoning challenges.10 The performance improvement over the older 2.0 Flash (when thinking is disabled) wasn't clearly quantified in initial benchmark releases.53 Enabling the thinking budget dramatically increases the output cost (by nearly 6 times), requiring careful cost management for applications relying heavily on its reasoning capabilities.44
- 
- 
- 
- Relevance/Integration (Cursor): Both Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Preview) are available within the Cursor IDE.56 Crucially, Cursor provides a specific "Gemini 2.5 Pro MAX" setting that enables the utilization of the full 1 million token context window. The standard Gemini 2.5 Pro setting within Cursor defaults to a smaller context, around 120,000 tokens.56 Accessing the MAX mode in Cursor involves an additional per-tool-call cost ($0.05 per call), separate from the underlying model's token costs.81 Users have reported positive experiences using Gemini 2.5 Pro MAX within Cursor, particularly for tasks benefiting from the large context, such as analyzing large codebases, complex refactoring, identifying logic errors, and aiding technical design.39 Some users find it less prone to unnecessary refactoring ("side quests") compared to other models like Claude within the Cursor environment.68 Gemini 2.5 Flash is available as a free model option in Cursor.56
- 
- 
- Understanding Google's Strategy:
- 
- Google's emphasis on the 1 million token context window (with 2M planned for Pro) serves as a primary competitive differentiator, particularly targeting enterprise users dealing with extensive data or complex codebases.11 The ability to process vast amounts of information—entire code repositories, lengthy documents, hours of video—in a single pass aims to simplify workflows that previously required complex engineering solutions like RAG pipelines.36 For engineers working on large-scale projects or needing to synthesize information from diverse, lengthy sources, this large context capability presents a potentially significant advantage, though practical usage within tools like Cursor may require specific modes and incur additional costs.81
- The introduction of "thinking models" 10 and the explicit "thinking budget" control in Gemini 2.5 Flash 10 represents Google's approach to balancing the trade-offs between reasoning depth, speed, and cost. Unlike OpenAI's strategy of offering separate generalist and reasoning model lines, Google provides this control within the Flash model itself. Developers can disable thinking for speed, allow automatic adjustment, or set a specific token budget.10 This offers fine-grained control suitable for production environments where optimizing cost and latency per task is crucial 53, although it necessitates active management of the budget and associated costs.44
- Google clearly positions the Gemini 2.5 series, particularly Pro, for enterprise adoption, emphasizing integration with the Vertex AI platform, upcoming features like tuning and context caching, and suitability for tasks demanding trust and compliance through transparent reasoning.11 While accessible to individual developers via Google AI Studio 10, the ecosystem and advanced features are tailored for deployment within the Google Cloud Platform. Bootcamp attendees should recognize that realizing the full enterprise potential of these models likely involves leveraging GCP infrastructure and services.

- 
- Models: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (latest), Claude 3 Opus (previous high-end), Claude 3.5 Haiku (latest fast model).14
- 
- 
- Key Characteristics:
- 
- Common Features: All listed models are multimodal, accepting text and image inputs to generate text.14 They share a 200,000 token context window.32 API access is available directly from Anthropic (using a prepaid credit system 85) and through cloud partners like AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex AI.32 A core design principle is safety and trustworthiness, often associated with Anthropic's "Constitutional AI" approach.14
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Anthropic's flagship and "most intelligent" model as of early 2025.14 It features toggleable "extended thinking" mode for deeper reasoning on complex problems.15 It boasts top-tier performance in coding, reasoning, and planning.14 It has a large maximum output of 64,000 tokens (with a beta option for 128k) and a knowledge cutoff of November 2024.16 Pricing is set at $3.00/$15.00 per million input/output tokens, with thinking tokens included in the output cost.32
- Claude 3 Opus: The previous top-performing model, still highly capable for complex analysis and tasks requiring fluency and understanding.14 It has an older knowledge cutoff (August 2023) and a smaller maximum output (4,096 tokens).32 Its main drawback is the significantly higher cost: $15.00/$75.00 Mtok.32
- Claude 3.5 Haiku: Anthropic's fastest and most cost-effective model.14 Optimized for near-instant responsiveness in tasks like knowledge retrieval or lightweight actions.31 It has a maximum output of 8,192 tokens and a July 2024 knowledge cutoff.32 Pricing is very competitive at $0.80/$4.00 Mtok..3232
- 
- 
- 
- Pros for Software Development:
- 
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Widely regarded as state-of-the-art for coding tasks. It achieves excellent scores on benchmarks like SWE-Bench Verified (70.3% with scaffold, 63.7% without) and excels in agentic coding, planning complex code changes, and frontend development.86 The extended thinking mode enhances its ability to tackle complex mathematical or logical problems within code.15 It demonstrates strong instruction following, effective tool selection, and error correction capabilities.86 The large potential output size (up to 128K tokens in beta) is advantageous for generating substantial code blocks or detailed plans.86 It has received strong endorsements from developers using tools like Cursor, Cognition, and Augment Code 86, and has shown capability in complex refactoring tasks.93
- Claude 3 Opus: Remains a highly intelligent model suitable for complex analytical tasks, multi-step reasoning, and situations demanding near-human levels of comprehension, which can be relevant for understanding intricate system designs or requirements.14
- Claude 3.5 Haiku: Offers exceptional speed and cost efficiency, making it ideal for tasks like rapid code completion, quick documentation lookups, simple code generation, or powering high-volume, low-latency developer tools.14 Despite its speed focus, it maintains good coding capabilities.17
- General Strengths: Anthropic models are generally noted for high accuracy and low hallucination rates compared to some competitors.14 They are less prone to refusing borderline prompts than earlier Claude versions.90 The 200K context window allows for good recall and processing of substantial code or documentation.90 The emphasis on safety and reduced bias is a key advantage for developing responsible applications.14
- 
- 
- 
- Cons/Limitations:
- 
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Achieving peak reasoning performance, especially in math and science, requires enabling the extended thinking mode.87 Some users find it can still produce overly complex solutions or struggle without very precise prompting and sufficient context.93 While competitively priced for its capability, it's more expensive than Haiku or models like Gemini Flash.32
- Claude 3 Opus: Its cost is substantially higher than Sonnet or Haiku, making it less economical for many use cases.32 The August 2023 knowledge cutoff is significantly older than Sonnet or Haiku.32 It is slower than the newer models and has a much smaller maximum output limit (4K tokens).32
- Claude 3.5 Haiku: Its capabilities are limited for highly complex reasoning or intricate coding tasks where Sonnet or Opus would be more suitable.14
- General Limitations: Claude models cannot access the live internet for real-time information.17 Fine-tuning capabilities, while potentially available, are not highlighted as prominently as for OpenAI or Google models. The API billing relies on a prepaid credit system, which may require different budget management compared to post-paid systems.85

- Relevance/Integration (Cursor): Claude models, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, are deeply integrated into Cursor and frequently cited as top choices within the IDE.4 Cursor offers native support for 3.7 Sonnet (including a "MAX" mode for the full 200K context), 3.5 Sonnet, 3.5 Haiku, and 3 Opus.56 Users consistently report excellent results using Sonnet 3.7 within Cursor for a wide range of coding tasks, including complex generation, planning, multi-file editing, and agentic operations.63 The tight integration makes Claude models highly practical and powerful options for engineers working within the Cursor environment.
- 
- 
- Understanding Anthropic's Strategy:
- 
- Anthropic leverages hybrid reasoning in its latest flagship model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet 15, as a key competitive feature. This allows users to toggle between standard (fast) and extended (deep reasoning) modes within a single, highly capable model. Unlike Google's Gemini Flash which prices thinking tokens separately 44, Sonnet's pricing includes thinking tokens in the standard output cost.87 This strategy offers flexibility, allowing users to opt for deeper analysis on complex problems without changing models or facing unpredictable cost surges based on reasoning intensity, simplifying the developer experience.
- A core pillar of Anthropic's value proposition is the emphasis on AI safety, reliability, and trustworthiness.14 This is consistently highlighted through discussions of "Constitutional AI," low hallucination rates, reduced bias (supported by benchmarks like BBQ 90), and careful risk assessments (ASL-2 rating 91). This focus contrasts sharply with reports of increased hallucinations in some competitor reasoning models 50 and positions Claude as a potentially more dependable choice for enterprise or critical applications where accuracy and safety are paramount.
- Anthropic has achieved strong integration and positive perception within key developer tools, most notably Cursor.4 The frequent mention of Claude 3.7 Sonnet as a default or preferred model in Cursor, coupled with features like the dedicated MAX mode 56, indicates a successful partnership and strong user adoption within that ecosystem. This deep integration makes Claude models particularly accessible and effective for engineers already using or considering Cursor.

- 
- 3.4 Meta: Llama 4 SeriesMeta AI continues its commitment to open-weight models with the Llama 4 series, introducing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and native multimodality.
- 
- Models: Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 4 Scout.18 (Llama 4 Behemoth is a larger preview model used for training Maverick/Scout).19
- 
- 
- Key Characteristics:
- 
- Common Features: Both Maverick and Scout are open-weight models released under the Llama 4 Community License.18 They utilize a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring 17 billion active parameters despite larger total parameter counts.18 They are natively multimodal (text and vision input, text output) using an "early fusion" approach and were trained on over 30 trillion tokens of text, image, and video data.18 Models are available for download (via llama.com, Hugging Face) and through cloud partners (AWS Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI, Cloudflare Workers AI, etc.).18 They were pretrained on 200 languages 101 and feature intentionally reduced safety filters compared to Llama 3, aiming for less refusal on contentious topics.101
- Llama 4 Maverick: Features 400 billion total parameters distributed across 128 experts.18 It has a 1 million token context window.20 Positioned as a high-quality, general-purpose model excelling in coding, reasoning, and multimodal tasks.18 Meta estimates API costs between $0.19-$0.49/Mtok (blended input/output) with optimized inference.38 It can run on a single H100 DGX host.95
- Llama 4 Scout: Features 109 billion total parameters with 16 experts.18 Its standout characteristic is an industry-leading (though potentially impractical) 10 million token context window.18 Optimized for efficiency and tasks involving long documents or large codebase analysis.18 It can run on a single H100 GPU when quantized.18
- 
- 
- 
- Pros for Software Development:
- 
- General Strengths: The open-weight nature offers significant flexibility for customization, fine-tuning, local deployment (potentially enhancing data privacy), and potentially lower long-term costs compared to proprietary APIs.19 The MoE architecture aims for efficiency by activating only 17B parameters per inference, while still benefiting from the knowledge encoded in the much larger total parameter count.18 Meta reports strong benchmark performance, claiming superiority over models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in coding, reasoning, and long-context tasks.18 Native multimodality is useful for interpreting diagrams or visual elements in development workflows.18 The large context windows (1M for Maverick, 10M for Scout) theoretically enable comprehensive analysis of large codebases or documentation sets.18
- Maverick: Positioned as the high-quality workhorse, competitive with strong models like DeepSeek v3.1 on coding and reasoning benchmarks.18 Offers good estimated price/performance.18
- Scout: The massive 10M context window is unprecedented and could, in theory, allow processing of extremely large projects or multi-document synthesis.18 Optimized for efficiency, runnable on a single (albeit powerful) GPU.18 Exhibits strong image grounding capabilities.18
- 
- 
- 
- Cons/Limitations:
- 
- General Weaknesses: Hosting MoE models, even with efficient inference, can be memory-intensive as the full weights (e.g., >200GB for Scout) need to be loaded.38 A significant concern is the discrepancy between Meta's reported benchmark prowess and initial independent user reviews, particularly for coding tasks. Several developers reported Llama 4 models performing poorly, sometimes worse than smaller competitors like Gemma 3 or Mistral 3, suggesting the models might have been rushed or benchmarks aren't reflecting real-world coding utility.95 The reduced safety filtering, while intended to make the model less "censorious," might pose risks in certain applications.101 Commercial use is subject to the Llama 4 Community License, which includes restrictions for very large companies (>700M MAU) and branding requirements.38 Vision capabilities are also restricted in the EU due to regulatory concerns.38
- Scout: The practical utility of the 10M token context window is highly questionable. Meta's own documentation suggests significant hardware (8x H100 GPUs) is needed even for 1.4M tokens.38 Performance likely degrades significantly at such extreme lengths, and comprehensive evaluations are lacking.38 Furthermore, initial API implementations by partners often drastically cap the context window (e.g., Cloudflare started at 128K).98
- Maverick: Requires substantial hardware (H100 host) or distributed inference setups for optimal performance and cost.38 Local deployment is generally infeasible for individual developers or small organizations.38
- 
- 
- 
- Relevance/Integration (Cursor): As of the latest available information 56, Cursor does not list Llama 4 Maverick or Scout as natively integrated models. While older Llama models can often be used in tools like Cursor via local execution frameworks (Ollama, LM Studio) or compatible third-party APIs (Fireworks, OpenRouter) 4, direct support for Llama 4 is not confirmed. Given the demanding hardware requirements for self-hosting and the mixed initial reviews regarding coding performance 104, Llama 4's immediate utility within a tool like Cursor might be limited compared to readily available, well-integrated models like Claude 3.7 or GPT-4.1, unless accessed through a performant partner API configured via Cursor's BYOK settings.107
- 
- 
- Understanding Meta's Strategy:
- 
- Meta continues its strategy of disrupting the LLM market through open-weight releases, using headline-grabbing specifications like the 10M token context window as a key differentiator against closed, proprietary models.18 This approach aims to foster a large developer community and establish Llama as a foundational technology, even if the most extreme specs are not immediately practical for widespread use. The open nature provides flexibility but shifts the burden of deployment and performance validation onto the user or third-party providers.
- The adoption of native multimodality and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Llama 4 represents a significant architectural evolution from Llama 3.18 Meta is betting on these technologies to deliver both high capability (leveraging large total parameters) and inference efficiency (activating only a fraction of parameters). This could yield substantial benefits if successful, but MoE introduces deployment challenges 98, and the initial mixed performance reviews suggest potential trade-offs or a need for further refinement.104
- There appears to be a potential disconnect between Meta's reported benchmark results for Llama 4 18 and the initial real-world coding experiences reported by some developers.104 This highlights the limitations of benchmarks and the importance of independent validation. It suggests that while Llama 4 might excel in specific benchmark tasks or other domains like multimodality or long-context reasoning, its practical utility for day-to-day coding might require further improvement or specific optimization. Engineers evaluating Llama 4 should prioritize hands-on testing for their specific coding needs over relying solely on published scores.

- Legacy/Open-Weight (API Deprecating): Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Mixtral 8x22B (Apache 2.0).21
- 
- 
- 
- Key Characteristics:
- 
- Mistral Large: Mistral's top-tier reasoning model available via API, designed for high-complexity tasks.22 It's a text-only model with a 131,000 token context window.23 API endpoint is mistral-large-latest.23 Pricing is $2.00/$6.00 Mtok (Input/Output).46 Accessing the model weights requires a Mistral Research License.23 It demonstrates strong performance in multilingual tasks, particularly French, German, Spanish, and Italian.109
- Codestral: A specialized model explicitly designed for code generation and related developer tasks.21 It operates on code modality and features a large 256,000 token context window.23 Accessed via the codestral-latest API endpoint 23, priced at $0.20/$0.60 Mtok.46 Licensing for the latest weights is not explicitly stated as Apache 2.0; a previous version required a Non-Production License.23 It supports over 80 programming languages 21 and is optimized for low latency, Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM), code correction, and test generation.23 Reports indicate it's significantly faster than its predecessor and competitors.111
- Ministral 8B: An efficient 8B parameter model optimized for edge deployment and offering a high performance-to-cost ratio.23 It's a text model with a 131k context window via API (128k for weights).23 Accessed via the ministral-8b-latest API endpoint 23 at a very low price of $0.10/$0.10 Mtok.112 Weights are available under Mistral Research and Commercial Licenses.23 It uses an interleaved sliding-window attention mechanism for speed and memory efficiency 113, making it suitable for low-latency applications, privacy-sensitive tasks, or as part of agentic workflows.112
- 
- 
- 
- Pros for Software Development:
- 
- Mistral Large: Its strong reasoning capabilities make it suitable for complex software design, architectural planning, and high-level problem-solving.109 While not specialized like Codestral, it possesses good general coding abilities.109 Its proficiency in multiple European languages can be beneficial for international teams or projects involving multilingual documentation or interfaces.109
- Codestral: Represents a state-of-the-art solution specifically for code generation. Its benchmark scores (e.g., HumanEval 86.6%) are highly competitive.111 Support for over 80 programming languages provides broad utility.40 The large 256k context window is advantageous for working with extensive code files or complex project structures.40 Its optimization for speed and common developer tasks like FIM, code completion, correction, and test generation directly enhances productivity.23 The API pricing is very competitive for a specialized model.46
- Ministral 8B: Offers remarkable efficiency, making it feasible for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices or as a low-cost API option for tasks like code completion, simple generation, or routing requests in agentic systems.24 Despite its small size, it supports a large 128k context window 112 and boasts strong performance relative to other sub-10B models.112 Its API pricing is extremely low.112
- General Mistral Ecosystem: Mistral provides a diverse portfolio, including legacy open-weight models (though API access is ending) and proprietary APIs via La Plateforme, which offers tools for fine-tuning, embedding generation, and function calling.23 Flexible deployment options include self-hosting (subject to licenses) or various cloud platforms.24
- 
- 
- 
- Cons/Limitations:
- 
- Mistral Large: It is less specialized for coding compared to Codestral, potentially yielding less optimal results for pure code generation tasks.109 The API cost is higher than Mistral Small or Ministral.46 The Research License requirement for weights restricts some commercial self-hosting scenarios.23
- Codestral: Being specialized for code, it is likely less capable than Mistral Large on general reasoning, creative writing, or other non-coding text tasks.23 The licensing terms for the latest weights might be restrictive for commercial self-hosting (a previous version had a Non-Production license).23
- Ministral 8B: Its overall capability ceiling is lower than larger or specialized models.116 It may struggle with highly complex coding logic or deep reasoning tasks where Mistral Large or Codestral would be preferred.116 The Research License for weights limits certain commercial uses.113
- General Mistral Ecosystem: Access to the weights of newer, high-performance models often requires specific Research or Commercial licenses, diverging from the fully open Apache 2.0 license of their earlier models.23 The planned deprecation of API access for the popular Apache 2.0 licensed Mistral 7B and Mixtral models (by March 2025) forces users towards newer, potentially licensed or paid API options.23
- 
- 
- 
- Relevance/Integration (Cursor): Direct, native integration of Mistral Large, Codestral, or Ministral 8B within Cursor is not confirmed by the official model list.56 However, Cursor does support OpenAI-compatible APIs 108 and allows configuration of external API keys.107 This suggests that developers could potentially use Mistral's API endpoints (hosted on La Plateforme or via partners like Azure AI Foundry 40) within Cursor if they configure it manually. Tools like Cline explicitly mention support for Mistral via BYOK.4 While older models like Mistral 7B might be run locally via Ollama and potentially integrated 55, accessing the latest, most powerful Mistral models within Cursor likely requires this manual API setup. Given Codestral's strong coding focus, seamless integration would be highly beneficial but appears lacking compared to OpenAI or Anthropic models.
- 
- 
- Understanding Mistral AI's Strategy:
- 
- Mistral AI employs a specialization strategy, developing models tailored for specific domains like code (Codestral) 23 and edge computing/efficiency (Ministral series) 23, alongside their general-purpose reasoning models (Mistral Large). This allows them to offer optimized performance and cost-effectiveness for particular use cases, potentially outperforming generalist models in those niches. Developers benefit from having tools specifically designed for coding or efficient deployment but need to select the appropriate model for their task.
- There's a noticeable shift in Mistral's approach to model access. While early success was built on permissive Apache 2.0 open-weight models, their newer, state-of-the-art offerings (Large, Codestral, Ministral) often come with more restrictive Research or Commercial licenses for weight access.23 Concurrently, API access for the older Apache 2.0 models is being phased out.23 This suggests a strategic move towards monetizing their latest innovations primarily through API access (La Plateforme) or licensed self-hosting, while still contributing to the open ecosystem, albeit in a more controlled manner.
- Mistral provides a clear spectrum of models balancing performance, efficiency, and cost.23 From the ultra-low-cost, high-efficiency Ministral models 112, through the mid-tier specialized Codestral 46, to the premium Mistral Large for complex reasoning 46, developers have options across various price points and capability levels. This allows users to optimize their spending by selecting the most appropriate model for each specific task within their workflow.

- 
- 3.6 Cohere: Command SeriesCohere focuses on providing AI models tailored for enterprise applications, with a strong emphasis on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool use, and multilingual capabilities relevant to global businesses.
- 
- Models: Command A (command-a-03-2025), Command R+ (e.g., command-r-plus-08-2024), Command R (e.g., command-r-08-2024).25 Cohere also offers specialized Embed and Rerank models crucial for RAG workflows.25
- 
- 
- Key Characteristics:
- 
- General Focus: Models are optimized for enterprise scenarios, particularly RAG, tool integration, and multilingual communication.25 They operate primarily with text modality.26 Access is via Cohere's API and major cloud platforms (AWS Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, Oracle OCI).26 Pricing is typically pay-as-you-go per token, with trial keys offering limited free access.47 Data privacy and security are highlighted as enterprise considerations.25
- Command A: Cohere's most performant and efficient model (reported as 111B parameters in one source 122). It excels in tool use, agentic tasks, RAG, and supports 23 languages.26 Features a 256,000 token context window and 8k max output tokens.26 Notably efficient, requiring only two high-end GPUs (A100/H100) for deployment and offering high throughput (1.75x GPT-4o, 2.4x DeepSeek V3).26 Pricing is $2.50/$10.00 Mtok (Input/Output).47
- Command R+: A powerful model specifically optimized for complex RAG workflows and multi-step tool use.25 It has a 128,000 token context window and 4k max output tokens.25 Supports 10 key global business languages.25 A unique feature is its ability to self-correct during multi-step tool use if an initial attempt fails.25 Pricing is $2.50/$10.00 Mtok.47
- Command R: A scalable and more cost-effective model suitable for production RAG, single-step tool use, and large-scale workloads.25 It shares the 128k context window and 10 language support with R+.25 Priced lower at $0.15/$0.60 Mtok.47 Fine-tuning is available for Command R.47
- *   **Pros for Software Development:**
- *   **Command A/R+:** Their strong aptitude for tool use and agentic workflows makes them highly suitable for automating complex development processes, integrating external APIs, or interacting with build systems.26 Excellence in RAG allows seamless integration with internal knowledge bases, extensive documentation repositories, or existing codebases to provide contextually grounded assistance.25 Large context windows (256k/128k) aid in maintaining coherence during complex, multi-file development tasks.25 Robust multilingual support is valuable for global development teams or software localization efforts.25 Command A offers significant efficiency and throughput advantages, potentially lowering deployment costs.26 Command R+'s multi-step tool use with self-correction enables more resilient automation.25
- *   **Command R:** Provides a budget-friendly option for implementing RAG-based coding assistants or simpler tool integrations in production environments.25 The availability of fine-tuning allows tailoring the model to specific internal codebases or development practices.47 It still benefits from a large 128k context window and 10-language support.25
- *   **General Strengths:** Cohere's enterprise focus suggests attention to reliability, security, and data privacy.25 Availability across multiple major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, OCI) offers deployment flexibility.26
- *   **Cons/Limitations:**
- *   **Command A/R+:** While coding is mentioned as part of the training data and use cases 26, it is not emphasized as a primary strength to the same extent as RAG or tool use, unlike models from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Mistral's Codestral.25 Performance on specific coding benchmarks (HumanEval, SWE-Bench) is often not reported or highlighted.122 Consequently, they might be less performant for pure code generation, complex debugging, or algorithmic tasks compared to specialized coding models. Command A is relatively new, potentially lacking extensive real-world validation compared to more established models. The pricing for Command R+ and Command A is at the higher end, comparable to other premium models.47
- *   **Command R:** Is less capable than R+ or A for tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning or sophisticated tool orchestration.117
- *   **General Limitations:** Like all LLMs, Cohere models are susceptible to biases present in training data and can potentially generate toxic or harmful content, although safety measures and evaluations (like BOLD) are in place.123 Usage guidelines restrict application in certain high-stakes scenarios.123 API rate limits exist, particularly for free trial keys.119 Some user reviews suggest limitations in general reasoning capabilities outside their core strengths of RAG and tool use.125
- *   **Relevance/Integration (Cursor):** Based on the available documentation 56, Cohere models (Command A, R+, R) are **not** listed as natively integrated options within Cursor IDE. While Cursor supports OpenAI-compatible APIs 108 and potentially external API key configurations 107, straightforward integration of Cohere models is not confirmed. Users wishing to leverage Cohere's RAG or tool use strengths within a Cursor-like environment might need to explore alternative tools or custom integration solutions.
- *   **Understanding Cohere's Strategy:**
- *   Cohere strategically differentiates itself by focusing intensely on enterprise needs, particularly robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and sophisticated tool use capabilities.25 Rather than solely pursuing leadership in raw generative benchmarks or open-weight distribution, Cohere provides tools designed to integrate AI effectively into existing enterprise workflows and knowledge systems. Their dedicated Embed and Rerank models further underscore this RAG-centric approach.25 This makes Cohere models particularly relevant for development teams building internal tools, knowledge assistants, or applications that need to interact heavily with proprietary data or APIs.
- *   Efficiency and scalability are key tenets of Cohere's value proposition, especially evident with Command A's design requiring significantly less hardware (2 GPUs) than comparable models while delivering high throughput.26 This directly addresses enterprise concerns about the cost and complexity of deploying powerful LLMs, particularly in private or on-premise environments. This focus on efficiency may involve performance trade-offs on certain academic benchmarks but prioritizes practical deployability.
- *   Cohere's multilingual support is specifically tailored for global business operations, focusing on key economic languages across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.25 This targeted approach ensures robust performance in languages critical for international enterprises, potentially offering deeper capability in these specific languages compared to models aiming for broader but potentially shallower coverage.
+ # LLM Comparative Analysis for Software Engineering (Early 2025)

+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 2. Understanding the Landscape: Key LLM Providers and Models (Early 2025)
+ 
+ ### Introduction to Major Players
+ 
+ The LLMs relevant to software development in early 2025 are primarily driven by a handful of influential organizations, each with distinct philosophies and model offerings:
+ 
+ - **OpenAI:** Known for its high-performance GPT series and the introduction of specialized "reasoning" models (o-series), often pushing state-of-the-art capabilities via proprietary APIs.
+ - **Google (DeepMind):** Offers the Gemini family, characterized by strong multimodal capabilities, exceptionally large context windows, and the concept of "thinking models" accessible via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.
+ - **Anthropic:** Focuses on developing capable and safe AI, emphasizing reliability, honesty, and reduced harmful outputs with its Claude models, often utilizing techniques like Constitutional AI.
+ - **Meta AI:** A major proponent of open-weight models, releasing powerful Llama models (including the Llama 4 series with MoE architecture and multimodality) under permissive licenses, fostering community development.
+ - **Mistral AI:** Another key player in the open-weight space, offering a range of models from highly efficient edge models (Ministral) to specialized code models (Codestral) and high-performance proprietary APIs via La Plateforme.
+ - **Cohere:** Targets enterprise use cases, with models like Command A/R+ optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool use, multilingual business communication, and scalability.
+ 
+ ### Model Families Overview
+ 
+ This report focuses on the following key models and families, selected for their state-of-the-art status or widespread use in software development contexts as of early 2025:
+ 
+ - **OpenAI:**
+     - GPT-4.1 Series: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano
+     - o-Series: o3, o4-mini
+ - **Google:**
+     - Gemini 2.5 Series: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash
+ - **Anthropic:**
+     - Claude Series: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Haiku
+ - **Meta:**
+     - Llama 4 Series: Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 4 Scout
+ - **Mistral AI:**
+     - Mistral Large (latest), Codestral (latest), Ministral 8B
+ - **Cohere:**
+     - Command Series: Command A, Command R+
+ 
+ ### Key Concepts for Comparison
+ 
+ To effectively evaluate these models, understanding the following concepts is crucial:
+ 
+ - **Modality:** Types of data a model can process (input) and generate (output). Common modalities include text, code, images, audio, and video. Multimodal models can handle multiple types, enabling tasks like generating code from a diagram or explaining an image.
+ - **Context Window:** The maximum amount of information (measured in tokens, roughly equivalent to word pieces) the model can consider at one time. Larger context windows allow models to process longer documents, entire codebases, or maintain conversation history more effectively. However, performance can sometimes degrade near the limit, and practical usage might be constrained by tools or cost.
+ - **Training Data Focus:** Models can be trained on general web data or have specialized training on specific domains like code or scientific literature. This influences their proficiency in particular tasks. Some models are explicitly trained for "reasoning" or step-by-step problem-solving.
+ - **API Access & Cost Models:** How developers access the model. Proprietary models typically offer APIs with per-token pricing, sometimes tiered based on usage or model capability. Open-weight models can be downloaded and self-hosted (requiring infrastructure management) or accessed via partner APIs.
+ - **Hallucinations:** Instances where the model generates plausible but factually incorrect, nonsensical, or fabricated information. Reducing hallucinations is a key challenge, especially for complex reasoning tasks.
+ - **Reasoning Capabilities:** The model's ability to perform logical inference, multi-step problem-solving, planning, and critical analysis. Some models explicitly employ techniques like chain-of-thought or have dedicated "thinking" phases.
+ - **Tool Use / Agentic Behavior:** The model's capacity to interact with external tools (like web search, code interpreters, databases, or custom APIs) to gather information or perform actions, enabling more complex, autonomous workflows.
+ - **IDE Integration:** How readily and effectively a model integrates into developer environments like VS Code or specialized AI IDEs such as Cursor. This includes native support, availability through extensions (e.g., Copilot), or configuration via API keys.

Context limits in Cursor may differ from model maximums unless MAX mode is used. Costs are approximate per million tokens and subject to change. BYOK/API implies manual configuration might be needed in Cursor.)Discussion of Major Trade-offsChoosing the right LLM involves navigating several key trade-offs:
- Performance vs. Cost: There is a clear correlation between model capability and cost. Top-performing models like OpenAI's o3, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus command premium prices.32 Mid-tier models like GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Llama 4 Maverick offer strong performance at a moderate cost.32 Budget-friendly options include GPT-4.1 mini/nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Command R, and Ministral 8B, each providing different levels of capability at significantly lower price points.32 MoE architectures in Llama 4 aim to provide high capability with potentially better cost efficiency than dense models of similar total size, but hosting complexity and real-world performance need careful evaluation.18
- Speed vs. Accuracy/Reasoning Depth: Models optimized for speed and low latency, such as GPT-4.1 nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash (with thinking budget 0), Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Ministral 8B, are ideal for interactive applications like code completion or quick queries.9 However, achieving the highest accuracy or tackling complex problems often requires models designed for deeper reasoning, which may inherently be slower or involve explicit "thinking" steps (like OpenAI's o-series, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash with budget, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking).8 Developers must choose based on whether responsiveness or depth of analysis is more critical for the specific task.
- Specialized vs. General-Purpose: The landscape includes highly specialized models targeting specific domains, such as OpenAI's o-series and Google/Anthropic's reasoning models for complex problem-solving 8, Mistral's Codestral for code generation 23, and Ministral for edge deployment.24 These specialists often outperform general-purpose models on their target tasks. However, general-purpose models like GPT-4.1 or Llama 4 Maverick aim for strong performance across a wider range of tasks.9 The choice depends on whether the primary need is broad applicability or optimized performance for a specific function like coding or reasoning.
- Open-Weight vs. Proprietary APIs: Open-weight models like Meta's Llama 4 or Mistral's legacy/Ministral offerings provide maximum flexibility.18 They allow for local deployment (enhancing data privacy), deep customization through fine-tuning, and potentially lower long-term operational costs, bypassing API fees.19 However, they require significant technical expertise and infrastructure to host and manage effectively.38 Licensing terms can also vary and may include restrictions on commercial use or require specific attribution.20 Proprietary APIs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral offer ease of use, managed infrastructure, and often access to the absolute state-of-the-art performance, but come with per-token costs, potential data privacy concerns (though providers often offer enterprise tiers with stricter guarantees), and less control over the underlying model.25
- Context Window Size vs. Reliability: While models now boast context windows of 1 million tokens or even more (Llama 4 Scout claiming 10M) 9, practical reliability across these vast lengths is not guaranteed. OpenAI's own tests showed accuracy drops for GPT-4.1 at the 1M limit 37, and the hardware requirements and performance implications of utilizing such large contexts can be substantial.38 Simple "needle-in-a-haystack" tests may not fully capture the ability to reason coherently over extremely long inputs.35 Furthermore, tools like Cursor may impose their own practical limits or pricing structures (e.g., MAX mode) on accessing these large contexts.39 Engineers should treat massive context windows as a potential capability but verify performance and consider cost implications for their specific use case rather than assuming flawless recall and reasoning at the maximum limit.
- Highlighting Standout Models for Specific TasksBased on the comparative analysis, certain models emerge as strong contenders for specific software development tasks:
- Complex Code Generation/Refactoring: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (especially with extended thinking), Gemini 2.5 Pro (leveraging large context), Mistral Codestral (highly specialized), GPT-4.1 (strong generalist), and OpenAI o3 (strong reasoning but potential limitations).
- Debugging Assistance: Models excelling in reasoning and understanding context are valuable here: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3.
- Code Explanation/Documentation: Most high-quality models perform well, including GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, due to their strong language understanding.
- Large Codebase Analysis: Models with genuinely usable large context windows are key: Gemini 2.5 Pro (especially in Cursor's MAX mode), Claude 3.7 Sonnet (in Cursor's MAX mode), GPT-4.1 (within its ~128k Cursor limit or via direct API). Llama 4 Scout's 10M window is theoretically applicable but practically challenging.
- Speed/Low Latency Tasks (e.g., Autocomplete): GPT-4.1 nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash (thinking budget 0), Claude 3.5 Haiku, Ministral 8B.
- Cost-Sensitive Production Use: Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Cohere Command R, Ministral 8B API, or potentially self-hosted open-weight models like Llama 4 or Mistral 7B/Mixtral (if performance suffices).
- Agentic Workflows/Tool Use: Models explicitly designed or excelling in this area include OpenAI o3/o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Cohere Command A/R+.
- 5. Integration Deep Dive: LLMs in Your IDE (Cursor Spotlight)Overview of Integration PatternsLLMs are integrated into developer workflows through various mechanisms:
- Native IDE Features: AI capabilities are built directly into the IDE itself. Examples include Cursor and Windsurf, which are often forks of VS Code designed around AI.5
- IDE Extensions: Plugins add AI functionality to existing popular IDEs like VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc. GitHub Copilot is the most prominent example.5 Tools like Cline also operate as extensions.4
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) API Configuration: Some tools allow users to configure their own API keys for various LLM providers, offering model flexibility.4
- Local Model Execution: Frameworks like Ollama or LM Studio enable running open-weight models (like Llama or Mistral 7B) locally, which can then sometimes be integrated with IDEs or tools.55
- Focus on CursorCursor has gained significant traction as an AI-first IDE, particularly relevant for this bootcamp.
- 
- Architecture: Cursor is fundamentally a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This provides developers with a familiar interface, layout, and compatibility with many VS Code extensions and settings, lowering the adoption barrier.5 However, it overlays this foundation with deeply integrated, native AI features.5
- 
- 
- Key AI Features: Cursor offers several core AI functionalities:
- 
- Composer (⌘+I): Allows generating or editing code across multiple specified files based on natural language instructions, showing a diff before applying changes.6
- Agent Mode (⌘+.): Enables the AI to autonomously determine which files to read/edit and what terminal commands to run to fulfill a higher-level request (e.g., "implement user registration").6 Often uses more capable models like Claude or o-series.56
- Context-aware Chat (⌘+L): A chat panel that understands the code currently being viewed or explicitly referenced. Supports dragging/dropping folders for context.6
- Terminal Integration (⌘+K): Allows running terminal commands via natural language prompts.6
- Other Features: Advanced code completion (with auto-imports for TS/Python) 6, a built-in Bug Finder (with associated costs) 129, codebase indexing for better context 107, @ symbols for referencing specific context (@files, @web, @git) 107, and customizable AI behavior via a .cursorrules file.107
- 
- 
- 
- Available Models (Native Integration): Cursor provides direct access to a wide range of models from various providers.56 As of early 2025, key natively supported models include:
- 
- Anthropic: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Standard & MAX), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus.
- Google: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Standard & MAX), Gemini 2.5 Flash (Preview).
- OpenAI: GPT-4.1 (Free), GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini (Free), o3, o4-mini (Free), o1, o1-mini, o3-mini. (Note: GPT-4.5 Preview also listed but deprecated by OpenAI 9).
- Others: DeepSeek V3/R1 (Fireworks), Grok 2 / 3-beta / 3-mini-beta (xAI).
- Cursor applies its own pricing logic for requests using these models, often involving a cost per request (e.g., $0.04 or $0.05 for premium/MAX models), distinct from the underlying provider's token costs.56 Free models like GPT-4.1, o4-mini, and Gemini 2.5 Flash are also offered.
- 
- 
- 
- BYOK/External Models: While primarily focused on its native integrations, Cursor does offer an "Override OpenAI Base URL" setting 108, suggesting compatibility with external OpenAI-compatible APIs. This could potentially allow users to connect to other providers or self-hosted models if they expose a compatible interface. Additionally, users often employ local execution tools like Ollama or LM Studio to run models like Llama 3 or Mistral 7B and then interact with them, although direct integration within Cursor's core AI features might be limited compared to native models.55
- 
- 
- Context Window Handling (Standard vs. MAX): This is a critical aspect of using Cursor effectively. For models with very large context windows (like Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1M or Claude 3.7 Sonnet's 200k), Cursor's standard mode significantly restricts the context actually sent to the model. It might prune files, send only outlines, or summarize content, often limiting the effective context to around 60k-120k tokens.39 To utilize the full context window of these models, users must select the designated "MAX" mode (available for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro).56 However, MAX mode incurs additional costs within Cursor, typically charged per tool call made by the Agent, on top of the initial prompt request cost.56 This makes leveraging the full context a conscious trade-off between capability and cost.
- 
- 
- User Experiences & Model Suitability within Cursor: Developer feedback highlights distinct preferences for different models within the Cursor environment:
- 
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Often praised for handling complex coding tasks, planning multi-file changes, agentic capabilities, and generating aesthetically pleasing frontend code.68 It's frequently cited as the default or a highly effective choice, especially in Agent mode.86
- GPT-4.1: Valued for its speed, precision in smaller edits, and tendency to generate simpler, less "over-engineered" code compared to others.63 Some find it requires fewer follow-up prompts.63 However, it may struggle with certain frameworks (e.g., Phoenix/Liveview reported 63) or generating very large outputs compared to Claude or Gemini.68
- Gemini 2.5 Pro (MAX): Highly regarded for tasks demanding large context understanding, such as analyzing entire codebases, complex refactoring, and fixing logic errors across multiple files.39
- General Observations: Agent mode performance can be inconsistent depending on the model and task complexity.128 Users appreciate the familiar VS Code base but sometimes encounter bugs or stability issues related to the AI features or frequent updates.134 The UX of integrating AI, particularly the diff view and chat interaction, is often seen as superior to copy-pasting with external tools.136
- 
- 
- 
- Implications of Cursor Integration:
- 
- The way Cursor implements and prices access to LLMs significantly shapes their practical utility. The context pruning in standard modes means that the theoretical maximum context window of a model like Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M tokens) is not accessible without opting into the more expensive MAX mode.39 The per-tool-call pricing in MAX mode adds another layer of cost consideration.56 This demonstrates that the IDE itself acts as a crucial layer influencing both capability and cost-effectiveness, requiring users to understand Cursor's specific mechanisms beyond just the raw model specs.
- Despite the mediating layer of the IDE, the inherent strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs remain apparent within Cursor. User reports consistently differentiate between models based on task suitability – Claude for planning, GPT-4.1 for precision/speed, Gemini for large context/refactoring.63 This reinforces that model selection is still a critical decision, even within an integrated environment. The IDE enhances usability but doesn't fully equalize the underlying AI engines.
- The AI-powered IDE space is characterized by rapid iteration and change. Cursor frequently updates, adding new models, features (like MAX mode or Agent capabilities), and adjusting integrations.4 Competitors like GitHub Copilot are also evolving quickly.130 This dynamic environment means that best practices and optimal model choices can shift rapidly. Engineers using these tools need to remain adaptable, stay informed about updates, and be prepared for occasional instability or feature changes.134

- 6. Practical Guidance for EngineersLeveraging LLMs effectively in software development requires more than just choosing a model; it involves understanding how to select the right tool for the task, interact with it effectively, and mitigate its inherent limitations.Model Selection FrameworkChoosing an appropriate LLM depends heavily on the specific context. Consider these factors:
- Task Type:
- 
- Simple Completion/Boilerplate: Faster, cheaper models (GPT-4.1 nano, Haiku, Ministral 8B, Gemini Flash w/o thinking) are often sufficient.
- Complex Logic/Algorithm Generation: High-reasoning models (o3, Gemini Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet w/ thinking) or specialized code models (Codestral) are preferable.
- Refactoring/Debugging Large Codebases: Models with large, reliable context windows and strong reasoning (Gemini Pro MAX, Claude 3.7 Sonnet MAX, GPT-4.1).
- Documentation/Explanation: Most high-quality models work well; consider cost and speed.
- Technical Design/Architecture: High-reasoning models capable of understanding broad context are best (o3, Gemini Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet).
- Agentic Workflows/Tool Use: Models explicitly designed for this (o-series, Command A/R+, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash).
- 
- 
- Project Complexity/Size: For small scripts or isolated functions, context window size is less critical. For large, multi-file projects, models with larger effective context windows (considering tool limitations like Cursor's MAX mode) are essential.39
- Need for Reasoning/Tool Use: If the task requires complex planning, multi-step logic, or interaction with external systems, choose models strong in reasoning and tool use.8
- Speed/Latency Requirements: For real-time feedback (like autocomplete), prioritize low-latency models.9 For background tasks, deeper reasoning models might be acceptable despite higher latency.
- Budget Constraints: Evaluate API costs per token/request and any tool-specific costs (like Cursor's MAX mode fees).43 Open-weight models offer potential savings if self-hosting is feasible.19
- Data Privacy Needs: For sensitive codebases, consider proprietary models with strong enterprise privacy guarantees, or opt for self-hosted open-weight models.25 Be aware of data usage policies for free tiers.44
- Availability in Preferred Tool: Check native integration (like Cursor's model list 56) versus the need for BYOK API configuration or local hosting setups. Native integration is generally easier.
- Effective Prompting for CodingHow you ask is as important as which model you ask. Best practices include:
- Clarity and Specificity: Provide clear, detailed, and unambiguous instructions. Avoid vague requests. This is especially important for models like GPT-4.1 that follow instructions literally.67 Define the desired programming language, libraries, and expected behavior.
- Context Provision: Give the model the necessary context. Include relevant code snippets, function signatures, error messages, file structures (using Cursor's @ symbols helps 107), or summaries of relevant documentation. Remember the effective context limit of your tool/mode (e.g., Cursor standard vs. MAX).39
- Role Setting and Constraints: Define the AI's role (e.g., "Act as a senior Python developer") and specify constraints. This includes desired output format (e.g., "Provide the output as a code diff" 9), coding style guidelines ("Follow PEP 8"), complexity limits ("Keep the solution simple and avoid unnecessary abstractions" 63), or negative constraints ("Do not use library X").67
- Iterative Refinement: Don't expect perfect results on the first try, especially for complex tasks. Break down large problems into smaller steps. Review the model's output, provide specific feedback on errors or omissions, and ask for revisions.67 Treat it like a pair programming session.
- Tool Use Prompting (for Agentic Models): If using models capable of tool use, provide clear instructions on when and how to use available tools. Specify the goal and let the model determine the steps, or guide its tool usage more explicitly if needed.8 Ensure the model knows what to do if it lacks information needed for a tool call (e.g., ask the user).67
- Mitigating LimitationsLLMs are powerful but imperfect. Strategies to manage their weaknesses include:
- Hallucinations/Accuracy: Always review and test LLM-generated code. Treat it as code written by an unfamiliar junior developer. Use linters, static analysis tools, and comprehensive unit/integration tests to verify correctness and identify bugs.3 Be particularly skeptical of factual claims or complex reasoning steps, especially from models with higher reported hallucination rates like the o-series.50 Cross-reference generated code using specific libraries or APIs against official documentation.37
- Context Window Issues: Be aware that performance can degrade at extreme context lengths, even if technically supported.37 For large codebase tasks in tools like Cursor, use MAX mode if necessary but monitor the associated costs.39 Structure prompts to place the most critical information where the model is most likely to attend to it (often nearer the beginning or end, though models are improving).
- Bias: Recognize that LLMs can reflect biases present in their training data.52 Review generated code and documentation for potentially unfair assumptions, stereotypes, or security implications stemming from bias. Choose models from providers emphasizing safety and bias mitigation (like Anthropic 90) if this is a major concern.
- Cost Management: Actively monitor API token consumption and tool-specific costs (e.g., Cursor requests).56 Use less expensive models (like GPT-4.1 nano, Haiku, Ministral 8B, Command R) for simpler, high-volume tasks.9 Leverage free tiers for experimentation 55 or explore cost-effective self-hosting for open-weight models if technically feasible. Understand the pricing implications of different modes (e.g., Cursor MAX, Gemini Flash thinking budget).44
- 7. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of AI-Assisted DevelopmentRecap of Key FindingsAs of early 2025, Large Language Models have become undeniably powerful tools within the software engineering domain. Leading models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and Cohere offer remarkable capabilities, including sophisticated code generation across numerous languages, deep reasoning for complex problem-solving, interaction with external tools for agentic workflows, and the ability to process vast amounts of context from large codebases and documentation. However, these advancements are accompanied by persistent challenges. Hallucination remains a concern, particularly with some reasoning-focused models. The reliability of performance across massive context windows is still under scrutiny. Cost-effectiveness varies significantly between models and usage patterns, and the rapid proliferation of specialized models necessitates careful selection. Integrating these models effectively into developer workflows, especially within tools like Cursor, requires understanding both the model's capabilities and the tool's specific implementation and pricing constraints.The Evolving LandscapeThe field of AI, particularly LLMs applied to software development, is characterized by exceptionally rapid progress.1 New models, improved architectures (like MoE or hybrid reasoning), enhanced tool integrations, and evolving IDE features (like Cursor's Agent mode or MAX context) are emerging constantly.4 Benchmarks are quickly saturated, and today's state-of-the-art model may be surpassed tomorrow. This dynamic environment demands continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation from engineers seeking to leverage these tools effectively. Staying informed about the latest model releases, tool updates, and evolving best practices is crucial.Human-in-the-LoopDespite their growing capabilities, LLMs should be viewed as powerful assistants or co-pilots, not autonomous replacements for human engineers.52 The limitations regarding accuracy, potential for bias, security vulnerabilities, and the inability to truly understand intent necessitate rigorous human oversight. Critical thinking, thorough code review, comprehensive testing, strategic architectural design, and ultimate responsibility for the final product remain firmly in the hands of the developer. Over-reliance without critical validation can lead to subtle bugs, security flaws, or poorly designed systems.3EmpowermentWhen approached with a clear understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and the importance of human oversight, LLMs offer immense potential to augment the software development process. They can automate tedious tasks, accelerate prototyping, provide novel solutions to complex problems, improve code quality through suggestions and analysis, and make development more accessible.2 By mastering the selection, prompting, and integration of these AI tools, engineers participating in the AI Ignition Bootcamp can significantly enhance their productivity, creativity, and ability to tackle the increasingly complex challenges of modern software engineering. The key lies in leveraging these models as powerful collaborators while retaining critical human judgment and control.

+ ### Discussion of Major Trade-offs
+ 
+ Choosing the right LLM involves navigating several key trade-offs:
+ 
+ - **Performance vs. Cost:** Top-performing models command premium prices. Mid-tier and budget-friendly options offer different levels of capability at lower price points.
+ - **Speed vs. Accuracy/Reasoning Depth:** Fast models are ideal for interactive applications, but deeper reasoning models are needed for complex tasks.
+ - **Specialized vs. General-Purpose:** Some models are highly specialized (e.g., Codestral for code), while others are generalists.
+ - **Open-Weight vs. Proprietary APIs:** Open-weight models offer flexibility and privacy but require infrastructure; proprietary APIs are easier to use but come with ongoing costs.
+ - **Context Window Size vs. Reliability:** Large context windows are powerful but may not be reliable at their limits; tool-imposed limits may apply.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 5. Integration Deep Dive: LLMs in Your IDE (Cursor Spotlight)
+ 
+ ### Overview of Integration Patterns
+ 
+ LLMs are integrated into developer workflows through various mechanisms:
+ 
+ - **Native IDE Features:** AI capabilities built directly into the IDE (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf)
+ - **IDE Extensions:** Plugins for existing IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
+ - **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) API Configuration:** Configure your own API keys for various LLM providers
+ - **Local Model Execution:** Run open-weight models locally (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio)
+ 
+ ### Focus on Cursor
+ 
+ Cursor is a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with deeply integrated, native AI features:
+ 
+ - **Composer (⌘+I):** Generate or edit code across multiple files based on natural language instructions
+ - **Agent Mode (⌘+.):** AI autonomously determines which files to read/edit and what terminal commands to run
+ - **Context-aware Chat (⌘+L):** Chat panel that understands the code currently being viewed or referenced
+ - **Terminal Integration (⌘+K):** Run terminal commands via natural language prompts
+ - **Other Features:** Advanced code completion, built-in Bug Finder, codebase indexing, @ symbols for referencing context, customizable AI behavior via `.cursorrules`
+ 
+ **Available Models (Native Integration):**
+ - Anthropic: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Standard & MAX), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus
+ - Google: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Standard & MAX), Gemini 2.5 Flash (Preview)
+ - OpenAI: GPT-4.1 (Free), GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini (Free), o3, o4-mini (Free), o1, o1-mini, o3-mini
+ - Others: DeepSeek V3/R1 (Fireworks), Grok 2 / 3-beta / 3-mini-beta (xAI)
+ 
+ **BYOK/External Models:**
+ - Cursor supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and local execution tools for open-weight models
+ 
+ **Context Window Handling (Standard vs. MAX):**
+ - Standard mode prunes context; MAX mode enables full context window (with additional cost)
+ 
+ **User Experiences & Model Suitability within Cursor:**
+ - Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Excellent for complex coding, planning, agentic capabilities
+ - GPT-4.1: Fast, precise, good for smaller edits
+ - Gemini 2.5 Pro (MAX): Best for large context/refactoring

+ 
+ ## 7. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of AI-Assisted Development
+ 
+ As of early 2025, Large Language Models have become undeniably powerful tools within the software engineering domain. Leading models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and Cohere offer remarkable capabilities, including sophisticated code generation across numerous languages, deep reasoning for complex problem-solving, interaction with external tools for agentic workflows, and the ability to process vast amounts of context from large codebases and documentation.
+ 
+ However, these advancements are accompanied by persistent challenges. Hallucination remains a concern, particularly with some reasoning-focused models. The reliability of performance across massive context windows is still under scrutiny. Cost-effectiveness varies significantly between models and usage patterns, and the rapid proliferation of specialized models necessitates careful selection. Integrating these models effectively into developer workflows, especially within tools like Cursor, requires understanding both the model's capabilities and the tool's specific implementation and pricing constraints.
+ 
+ ### The Evolving Landscape
+ 
+ The field of AI, particularly LLMs applied to software development, is characterized by exceptionally rapid progress. New models, improved architectures (like MoE or hybrid reasoning), enhanced tool integrations, and evolving IDE features (like Cursor's Agent mode or MAX context) are emerging constantly. Benchmarks are quickly saturated, and today's state-of-the-art model may be surpassed tomorrow. This dynamic environment demands continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation from engineers seeking to leverage these tools effectively. Staying informed about the latest model releases, tool updates, and evolving best practices is crucial.
+ 
+ ### Human-in-the-Loop
+ 
+ Despite their growing capabilities, LLMs should be viewed as powerful assistants or co-pilots, not autonomous replacements for human engineers. The limitations regarding accuracy, potential for bias, security vulnerabilities, and the inability to truly understand intent necessitate rigorous human oversight. Critical thinking, thorough code review, comprehensive testing, strategic architectural design, and ultimate responsibility for the final product remain firmly in the hands of the developer. Over-reliance without critical validation can lead to subtle bugs, security flaws, or poorly designed systems.
+ 
+ ### Empowerment
+ 
+ When approached with a clear understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and the importance of human oversight, LLMs offer immense potential to augment the software development process. They can automate tedious tasks, accelerate prototyping, provide novel solutions to complex problems, improve code quality through suggestions and analysis, and make development more accessible. By mastering the selection, prompting, and integration of these AI tools, engineers participating in the AI Ignition Bootcamp can significantly enhance their productivity, creativity, and ability to tackle the increasingly complex challenges of modern software engineering. The key lies in leveraging these models as powerful collaborators while retaining critical human judgment and control.

- Prompt Engineering
- 
- You don't need to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - everyone can write a prompt.
- Introduction
- 
- When thinking about a large language model input and output, a text prompt (sometimes accompanied by other modalities such as image prompts) is the input the model uses to predict a specific output.
- You don't need to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - everyone can write a prompt.
- However, crafting the most effective prompt can be complicated. Many aspects of your prompt affect its efficacy: the model you use, the model's training data, the model configurations, your word-choice, style and tone, structure, and context all matter.
- Therefore, prompt engineering is an iterative process. Inadequate prompts can lead to ambiguous, inaccurate responses, and can hinder the model's ability to provide meaningful output.

- 
- When you chat with the Gemini chatbot, you basically write prompts, however this whitepaper focuses on writing prompts for the Gemini model within Vertex Al or by using the API, because by prompting the model directly you will have access to the configuration such as temperature etc.
- 
- This whitepaper discusses prompt engineering in detail.
- We will look into the various prompting techniques to help you getting started and share tips and best practices to become a prompting expert.
- We will also discuss some of the challenges you can face while crafting prompts.
- 
- Prompt engineering
- 
- Remember how an LLM works;
- it's a prediction engine. The model takes sequential text as an input and then predicts what the following token should be, based on the data it was trained on.
- The LLM is operationalized to do this over and over again, adding the previously predicted token to the end of the sequential text for predicting the following token.
- The next token prediction is based on the relationship between what's in the previous tokens and what the LLM has seen during its training.
- When you write a prompt, you are attempting to set up the LLM to predict the right sequence of tokens.
- Prompt engineering is the process of designing high-quality prompts that guide LLMs to produce accurate outputs.
- This process involves tinkering to find the best prompt, optimizing prompt length, and evaluating a prompt's writing style and structure in relation to the task.
- In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, a prompt is an input provided to the model to generate a response or prediction.

- 
- Prompt Engineering
- 
- These prompts can be used to achieve various kinds of understanding and generation tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, question and answering, text classification, language or code translation, code generation, and code documentation or reasoning.
- Please feel free to refer to Google's prompting guides 2.3 with simple and effective prompting examples.
- When prompt engineering, you will start by choosing a model.
- Prompts might need to be optimized for your specific model, regardless of whether you use Gemini language models in Vertex AI, GPT, Claude, or an open source model like Gemma or LLaMΑ.
- Besides the prompt, you will also need to tinker with the various configurations of a LLM.
- LLM output configuration
- 
- Once you choose your model you will need to figure out the model configuration.
- Most LLMs come with various configuration options that control the LLM's output.
- Effective prompt engineering requires setting these configurations optimally for your task.
- Output length
- 
- An important configuration setting is the number of tokens to generate in a response.
- Generating more tokens requires more computation from the LLM, leading to higher energy consumption, potentially slower response times, and higher costs.
- September 2024

- 
- **PAGE 9**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- 
- Reducing the output length of the LLM doesn't cause the LLM to become more stylistically or textually succinct in the output it creates, it just causes the LLM to stop predicting more tokens once the limit is reached.
- If your needs require a short output length, you'll also possibly need to engineer your prompt to accommodate.
- Output length restriction is especially important for some LLM prompting techniques, like ReAct, where the LLM will keep emitting useless tokens after the response you want.
- Sampling controls
- 
- LLMs do not formally predict a single token. Rather, LLMs predict probabilities for what the next token could be, with each token in the LLM's vocabulary getting a probability.
- Those token probabilities are then sampled to determine what the next produced token will be.
- Temperature, top-K, and top-P are the most common configuration settings that determine how predicted token probabilities are processed to choose a single output token.
- Temperature
- 
- Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Lower temperatures are good for prompts that expect a more deterministic response, while higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or unexpected results.
- A temperature of 0 (greedy decoding) is deterministic: the highest probability token is always selected (though note that if two tokens have the same highest predicted probability, depending on how tiebreaking is implemented you may not always get the same output with temperature 0).
- Temperatures close to the max tend to create more random output.
- And as temperature gets higher and higher, all tokens become equally likely to be the next predicted token.

- 
- **PAGE 10**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- 
- The Gemini temperature control can be understood in a similar way to the softmax function used in machine learning.
- A low temperature setting mirrors a low softmax temperature (T), emphasizing a single, preferred temperature with high certainty.
- A higher Gemini temperature setting is like a high softmax temperature, making a wider range of temperatures around the selected setting more acceptable.
- This increased uncertainty accommodates scenarios where a rigid, precise temperature may not be essential like for example when experimenting with creative outputs.
- Top-K and top-P
- 
- Top-K and top-P (also known as nucleus sampling) are two sampling settings used in LLMs to restrict the predicted next token to come from tokens with the top predicted probabilities.
- Like temperature, these sampling settings control the randomness and diversity of generated text.
- Top-K sampling selects the top K most likely tokens from the model's predicted distribution.
- The higher top-K, the more creative and varied the model's output;
- the lower top-K, the more restive and factual the model's output. A top-K of 1 is equivalent to greedy decoding.
- Top-P sampling selects the top tokens whose cumulative probability does not exceed a certain value (P).
- Values for P range from 0 (greedy decoding) to 1 (all tokens in the LLM's vocabulary).
- The best way to choose between top-K and top-P is to experiment with both methods (or both together) and see which one produces the results you are looking for.

- 
- **PAGE 11**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- 
- Another important configuration setting is the number of tokens to generate in a response.
- Be aware, generating more tokens requires more computation from the LLM, leading to higher energy consumption and potentially slower response times, which leads to higher costs.
- Putting it all together
- 
- Choosing between top-K, top-P, temperature, and the number of tokens to generate, depends on the specific application and desired outcome, and the settings all impact one another.
- It's also important to make sure you understand how your chosen model combines the different sampling settings together.
- If temperature, top-K, and top-P are all available (as in Vertex Studio), tokens that meet both the top-K and top-P criteria are candidates for the next predicted token, and then temperature is applied to sample from the tokens that passed the top-K and top-P criteria.
- If only top-K or top-P is available, the behavior is the same but only the one top-K or P setting is used.
- If temperature is not available, whatever tokens meet the top-K and/or top-P criteria are then randomly selected from to produce a single next predicted token.
- At extreme settings of one sampling configuration value, that one sampling setting either cancels out other configuration settings or becomes irrelevant.
- If you set temperature to 0, top-K and top-P become irrelevant-the most probable token becomes the next token predicted.
- If you set temperature extremely high (above 1-generally into the 10s), temperature becomes irrelevant and whatever tokens make it through the top-K and/or top-P criteria are then randomly sampled to choose a next predicted token.

- 
- **PAGE 12**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- 
- If you set top-K to 1, temperature and top-P become irrelevant.
- Only one token passes the top-K criteria, and that token is the next predicted token.
- If you set top-K extremely high, like to the size of the LLM's vocabulary, any token with a nonzero probability of being the next token will meet the top-K criteria and none are selected out.
- If you set top-P to O (or a very small value), most LLM sampling implementations will then only consider the most probable token to meet the top-P criteria, making temperature and top-K irrelevant.
- If you set top-P to 1, any token with a nonzero probability of being the next token will meet the top-P criteria, and none are selected out.
- As a general starting point, a temperature of .2, top-P of .95, and top-K of 30 will give you relatively coherent results that can be creative but not excessively so.
- If you want especially creative results, try starting with a temperature of .9, top-P of .99, and top-K of 40. And if you want less creative results, try starting with a temperature of .1, top-P of .9, and top-K of 20.
- Finally, if your task always has a single correct answer (e.g., answering a math problem), start with a temperature of 0.
- 
- NOTE: With more freedom (higher temperature, top-K, top-P, and output tokens), the LLM might generate text that is less relevant.
- Prompting techniques
- 
- LLMs are tuned to follow instructions and are trained on large amounts of data so they can understand a prompt and generate an answer.
- But LLMs aren't perfect; the clearer your prompt text, the better it is for the LLM to predict the next likely text.
- Additionally, specific techniques that take advantage of how LLMs are trained and how LLMs work will help you get the relevant results from LLMs

- Prompt Engineering
- 
- Now that we understand what prompt engineering is and what it takes, let's dive into some examples of the most important prompting techniques.
- General prompting / zero shot
- 
- A zero-shot prompt is the simplest type of prompt.
- It only provides a description of a task and some text for the LLM to get started with.
- This input could be anything: a question, a start of a story, or instructions. The name zero-shot stands for 'no examples'.
- Let's use Vertex Al Studio (for Language) in Vertex Al, which provides a playground to test prompts.
- In Table 1, you will see an example zero-shot prompt to classify movie reviews.
- The table format as used below is a great way of documenting prompts.
- Your prompts will likely go through many iterations before they end up in a codebase, so it's important to keep track of your prompt engineering work in a disciplined, structured way.
- More on this table format, the importance of tracking prompt engineering work, and the prompt development process is in the Best Practices section later in this chapter ("Document the various prompt attempts").
- The model temperature should be set to a low number, since no creativity is needed, and we use the gemini-pro default top-K and top-P values, which effectively disable both settings (see 'LLM Output Configuration' above).
- Pay attention to the generated output. The words disturbing and masterpiece should make the prediction a little more complicated, as both words are used in the same sentence.

+ 
+ ## LLM Output Configuration
+ 
+ LLMs offer several configuration options that control their output:
+ 
+ - **Output Length:** Number of tokens to generate. More tokens = more computation, higher cost.
+ - **Temperature:** Controls randomness. Lower = more deterministic, higher = more creative.
+ - **Top-K:** Restricts output to the top K most likely tokens.
+ - **Top-P (Nucleus Sampling):** Restricts output to the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds P.
+ 
+ **Example Settings:**
+ 
+ | Setting      | Typical Value | Effect                        |
+ |-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
+ | Temperature | 0.1 - 0.9    | Lower = deterministic, higher = creative |
+ | Top-K       | 20 - 40      | Higher = more creative        |
+ | Top-P       | 0.9 - 0.99   | Higher = more creative        |

+ 
+ ### Zero-shot Prompting
+ 
+ A simple prompt with no examples. Useful for straightforward tasks.
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ ```
  Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.
- Review: ""Her"" is a disturbing study revealing the direction
- humanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,
- unchecked. I wish there were more movies like this masterpiece.
+ Review: "Her" is a disturbing study revealing the direction humanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving, unchecked. I wish there were more movies like this masterpiece.
  Sentiment:

- "Output
- ","POSITIVE

- Table 1. An example of zero-shot prompting
- 
- When zero-shot doesn't work, you can provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt, which leads to "one-shot" and "few-shot" prompting.
- General prompting / zero shot
- 
- One-shot & few-shot
- 
- When creating prompts for Al models, it is helpful to provide examples.
- These examples can help the model understand what you are asking for.
- Examples are especially useful when you want to steer the model to a certain output structure or pattern.
- A one-shot prompt, provides a single example, hence the name one-shot.
- The idea is the model has an example it can imitate to best complete the task.
- A few-shot prompt provides multiple examples to the model. This approach shows the model a pattern that it needs to follow.
- The idea is similar to one-shot, but multiple examples of the desired pattern increases the chance the model follows the pattern.

- 
- The number of examples you need for few-shot prompting depends on a few factors, including the complexity of the task, the quality of the examples, and the capabilities of the generative Al (gen Al) model you are using.
- As a general rule of thumb, you should use at least three to five examples for few-shot prompting.
- However, you may need to use more examples for more complex tasks, or you may need to use fewer due to the input length limitation of your model.
- Table 2 shows a few-shot prompt example, let's use the same gemini-pro model configuration settings as before, other than increasing the token limit to accommodate the need for a longer response.

- Table 2. An example of few-shot prompting
- 
- When you choose examples for your prompt, use examples that are relevant to the task you want to perform.
- The examples should be diverse, of high quality, and well written.
- One small mistake can confuse the model and will result in undesired output.
- If you are trying to generate output that is robust to a variety of inputs, then it is important to include edge cases in your examples.
- Edge cases are inputs that are unusual or unexpected, but that the model should still be able to handle.

- 
- System, contextual and role prompting
- 
- System, contextual and role prompting are all techniques used to guide how LLMs generate text, but they focus on different aspects:
- 
- System prompting sets the overall context and purpose for the language model.
- It defines the 'big picture' of what the model should be doing, like translating a language, classifying a review etc.
- 
- Contextual prompting provides specific details or background information relevant to the current conversation or task.
- It helps the model to understand the nuances of what's being asked and tailor the response accordingly.
- Role prompting assigns a specific character or identity for the language model to adopt.
- This helps the model generate responses that are consistent with the assigned role and its associated knowledge and behavior.
- There can be considerable overlap between system, contextual, and role prompting. E.g.
- a prompt that assigns a role to the system, can also have a context.
- However, each type of prompt serves a slightly different primary purpose:
- 
- System prompt: Defines the model's fundamental capabilities and overarching purpose.
- Contextual prompt: Provides immediate, task-specific information to guide the response.
- It's highly specific to the current task or input, which is dynamic.
- Role prompt: Frames the model's output style and voice. It adds a layer of specificity and personality.

- Distinguishing between system, contextual, and role prompts provides a framework for designing prompts with clear intent, allowing for flexible combinations and making it easier to analyze how each prompt type influences the language model's output.
- Let's dive into these three different kinds of prompts.

- Table 3 contains a system prompt, where I specify additional information on how to return the output.
- I increased the temperature to get a higher creativity level, and I specified a higher token limit.

- 
- System prompts can be useful for generating output that meets specific requirements.
- The name 'system prompt' actually stands for 'providing an additional task to the system'.
- For example, you could use a system prompt to generate a code snippet that is compatible with a specific programming language, or you could use a system prompt to return a certain structure.
- Have a look into Table 4, where I return the output in JSON format.

- 
- There are some benefits in returning JSON objects from a prompt that extracts data.
- In a real-world application I don't need to manually create this JSON format, I can already return the data in a sorted order (very handy when working with datetime objects), but most importantly, by prompting for a JSON format it forces the model to create a structure and limit hallucinations.
- System prompts can also be really useful for safety and toxicity.
- To control the output, simply add an additional line to your prompt like: 'You should be respectful in your answer.'.
- Role prompting
- 
- Role prompting is a technique in prompt engineering that involves assigning a specific role to the gen Al model.
- This can help the model to generate more relevant and informative output, as the model can craft its responses to the specific role that it has been assigned.
- For example, you could role prompt a gen Al model to be a book editor, a kindergarten teacher, or a motivational speaker.
- Once the model has been assigned a role, you can then give it prompts that are specific to that role.
- For example, you could prompt a teacher to create a lesson plan that they can then review.
- Have a look into Table 5, where the model takes the role of a travel guide.

+ ### System, Contextual, and Role Prompting
+ 
+ - **System Prompting:** Sets the overall context and purpose.
+ - **Contextual Prompting:** Provides specific details or background.
+ - **Role Prompting:** Assigns a persona or style to the model.
+ 
+ **System Example:**
+ ```
+ Classify movie reviews as positive, neutral or negative. Only return the label in uppercase.
+ Review: "Her" is a disturbing study revealing the direction humanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving, unchecked. It's so disturbing I couldn't watch it.
+ Sentiment:
+ ```
+ **Output:**

- Step-back prompting
- 
- Step-back® prompting is a technique for improving the performance by prompting the LLM to first consider a general question related to the specific task at hand, and then feeding the answer to that general question into a subsequent prompt for the specific task.
- This 'step back' allows the LLM to activate relevant background knowledge and reasoning processes before attempting to solve the specific problem.
- By considering the broader and underlying principles, LLMs can generate more accurate and insightful responses.
- Step-back prompting encourages LLMs to think critically and apply their knowledge in new and creative ways.
- It changes the final prompt doing the task by utilizing more knowledge in the LLM's parameters than would otherwise come into play when the LLM is prompted directly.
- It can help to mitigate biases in LLM responses, by focusing on general principles instead of specific details, step-back prompting.
- Let's have a look into these examples to understand how step-back prompting can improve the results.
- Let's first review a traditional prompt (Table 8) before we compare it to a step back prompt (Table 9):

- Chain of Thought (CoT)
- 
- Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by generating intermediate reasoning steps.
- This helps the LLM generate more accurate answers. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding as it's a challenge with a zero-shot chain of thought.
- CoT has a lot of advantages. First of all, it's low-effort while being very effective and works well with off-the-shelf LLMs (so no need to finetune).
- You also get interpretability with CoT prompting, as you can learn from the LLM's responses and see the reasoning steps that were followed.
- If there's a malfunction, you will be able to identify it.
- Chain of thought appears to improve robustness when moving between different LLM versions.
- Which means the performance of your prompt should drift less between different LLMs than if your prompt does not use reasoning chains.
- Of course there are also disadvantages, but they are somewhat intuitive.
- The LLM response includes the chain of thought reasoning, which means more output tokens, which means predictions cost more money and take longer.
- To explain the following example in Table 11, let's first try to create a prompt that is not using CoT prompting to showcase the flaws of a large language model.
- Prompt
- 
- When I was 3 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now, I am 20 years old.
- How old is my partner?
- 
- Output
- 
- 63 years old

- 
- Prompt Engineering
- 
- Yikes. That's obviously the wrong answer. As a matter of fact, LLMs often struggle with mathematical tasks and can provide incorrect answers - even for a task as simple as multiplying two numbers.
- This is because they are trained on large volumes of text and math may require a different approach.
- So let's see if intermediate reasoning steps will improve the output.
- 
- The following table:
- "Prompt
- ","When I was 3 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now,
- I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step
- by step.
- "
- "Output
- ","1. Let's assume my current age is ""x"" years.
- "
- ,"2. When I was 3 years old, my age was 3 years.
- "
- ,"3. My partner's age at that time was 3 times my age, which means my partner's
- "
- ,"age was $3^{\*}3=9$ years.
- "
- ,"4. Now, I am 20 years old, which means my age has increased by $20-3=17$
- years since I was 3 years old.
- "
- ,"5. Since my partner's age was 9 years when I was 3 years old, and my age has
- increased by 17 years, my partner's age must have also increased by 17 years.
- "
- ,"6. Therefore, my partner's current age is $9+17=26$ years.
- "
- ,"So, my partner is 26 years old.
- "
- 
- Table 12. An example of Chain of Thought prompting
- 
- Alright, now the final answer is correct.
- That's because we clearly instructed the LLM to explain each step instead of just returning an answer.
- It's interesting to see that the model adds up the 17 increased years.
- In my head I would take the difference of years between my partner and me and add those up. $(20+(9-3))$.
- Let's help the model to think a little bit more like me.

- Table 13. An example of chain of thought prompting with a single-shot
- 
- Chain of thought can be useful for various use-cases.
- Think of code generation, for breaking down the request into a few steps, and mapping those to specific lines of code.
- Or for creating synthetic data when you have some kind of seed like "The product is called XYZ, write a description guiding the model through the assumptions you would make based on the product given title."
- Generally, any task that can be solved by 'talking through is a good candidate for a chain of thought.
- If you can explain the steps to solve the problem, try chain of thought.
- Please refer to the notebook10 hosted in the Google Cloud Platform Github repository which will go into further detail on CoT prompting:

- 
- In the best practices section of this chapter, we will learn some best practices specific to Chain of thought prompting.
- Self-consistency
- 
- While large language models have shown impressive success in various NLP tasks, their ability to reason is often seen as a limitation that cannot be overcome solely by increasing model size.
- As we learned in the previous Chain of Thought prompting section, the model can be prompted to generate reasoning steps like a human solving a problem.
- However CoT uses a simple 'greedy decoding' strategy, limiting its effectiveness.
- Self-consistency" combines sampling and majority voting to generate diverse reasoning paths and select the most consistent answer. It improves the accuracy and coherence of responses generated by LLMs.
- 
- Self-consistency gives a pseudo-probability likelihood of an answer being correct, but obviously has high costs.
- 
- It follows the following steps:
- 
- 1.  Generating diverse reasoning paths: The LLM is provided with the same prompt multiple times. A high temperature setting encourages the model to generate different reasoning paths and perspectives on the problem.
- 
- 2.  Extract the answer from each generated response.
- 
- 3.  Choose the most common answer.
- 
- Let's look into an example of an email classification system, which classifies an email as IMPORTANT or NOT
- IMPORTANT. A zero-shot chain of thought prompt will be sent to the LLM multiple times, to see if the responses differ after each submit. Notice the friendly tone, the word choice and the sarcasm that's been used in the email. All this could trick the LLM.

- Table 14. An example of prompting for self consistency
- 
- You can use the above prompt and try to see if it returns a consistent classification.
- Depending on the model that you are using and the temperature configuration, it might return "IMPORTANT" or "NOT IMPORTANT".

- 
- By generating many Chains of Thoughts, and taking the most commonly occurring answer ("IMPORTANT"), we can get a more consistently correct answer from the LLM.
- This example shows how self-consistency prompting can be used to improve the accuracy of an LLM's response by considering multiple perspectives and selecting the most consistent answer.
- Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
- 
- Now that we are familiar with chain of thought and self-consistency prompting, let's review Tree of Thoughts (ToT).12 It generalizes the concept of CoT prompting because it allows LLMs to explore multiple different reasoning paths simultaneously, rather than just following a single linear chain of thought.
- This is depicted in Figure 1.

- 
- Figure 1. A visualization of chain of thought prompting on the left versus.
- Tree of Thoughts prompting on the right
- 
- This approach makes ToT particularly well-suited for complex tasks that require exploration.
- It works by maintaining a tree of thoughts, where each thought represents a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward solving a problem.
- The model can then explore different reasoning paths by branching out from different nodes in the tree.
- There's a great notebook, which goes into a bit more detail showing The Tree of Thought (ToT) which is based on the paper 'Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought'.
- ReAct (reason & act)
- 
- Reason and act (ReAct) [10] 13 prompting is a paradigm for enabling LLMs to solve complex tasks using natural language reasoning combined with external tools (search, code interpreter etc.) allowing the LLM to perform certain actions, such as interacting with external APIs to retrieve information which is a first step towards agent modeling.
- ReAct mimics how humans operate in the real world, as we reason verbally and can take actions to gain information.
- ReAct performs well against other prompt engineering approaches in a variety of domains.
- ReAct prompting works by combining reasoning and acting into a thought-action loop.
- The LLM first reasons about the problem and generates a plan of action.
- It then performs the actions in the plan and observes the results.
- The LLM then uses the observations to update its reasoning and generate a new plan of action.
- This process continues until the LLM reaches a solution to the problem.

- To see this in action, you need to write some code.
- In code Snippet 11 am using the langchain framework for Python, together with VertexAl (google-cloud-aiplatform) and the google-search-results pip packages.
- To run this sample you must create a (free) SerpAPI key from [https://serpapi.com/manage-](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://serpapi.com/manage-) api-key and set an environment variable SERPAPI\_API\_KEY.
- Next let's write some Python code, with the task for the LLM to figure out: How many children have a famous dad that performs in the band Metallica.
- Python
- 
- from langchain.agents import load\_tools
- 
- from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent
- 
- from langchain.agents import AgentType
- 
- from langchain.llms import VertexAI
- 
- prompt = "How many kids do the band members of Metallica have?"
- 11m VertexAI (temperature=0.1)

- 
- Snippet 1. Creating a ReAct Agent with LangChain and VertexAl
- 
- Code Snippet 2 shows the result.
- Notice that ReAct makes a chain of five searches. In fact, the LLM is scraping Google search results to figure out the band names.
- Then, it lists the results as observations and chains the thought for the next search.

- 
- ReAct prompting in practice requires understanding that you continually have to resend the previous prompts/responses (and do trimming of the extra generated content) as well as set up the model with appropriate examples/instructions.
- Please refer to the notebook¹4 hosted in the GoogleCloud Platform Github repository, which goes into a bit more detail showing the actual LLM inputs and outputs with a more elaborate example
- 
- Automatic Prompt Engineering
- 
- At this point you might realize that writing a prompt can be complex.
- Wouldn't it be nice to automate this (write a prompt to write prompts)? Well, there's a method: Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE).
- This method15 not only alleviates the need for human input but also enhances the model's performance in various tasks.
- You will prompt a model to generate more prompts. Evaluate them, possibly alter the good ones. And repeat.
- For example, you can use automatic prompt engineering that will help with training a chatbot for a merchandise t-shirt webshop.
- We want to figure out all the various ways customers could phrase their order for buying a band merchandise t-shirt.
- 
- 1.  Write the prompt which will generate the output variants. In this example, I am using gemini-pro to generate 10 instructions.

- Test the code by opening a Terminal window, and execute the following command python file\_renamer.py.
- NOTE: When prompting for (Python) code in the Language Studio in Vertex Al, you will have to click on the 'Markdown' button.
- Otherwise you will receive plain text which is missing the proper indenting of lines, which is important for running Python code.
- Prompts for debugging and reviewing code
- 
- Let's manually write some edits to the code of Table 18. It should prompt the user for the filename prefix, and write this prefix in upper case characters.

- Prompt \# Create a new file name with the prefix "draft\_"
- new\_filename = f"{text}\_{file}"

- # Move the file to the new name

- # Print a success message
- 
- print("Files renamed successfully.")
- 
- ````
- Output The code calls the `toUpperCase` function to convert `prefix` to uppercase, but
- that function is not defined.
- To fix this issue, you can use the `upper()` method of
- the string class which converts a given string into uppercase.
- The modified code
- is shown below:
+ ```
+ **Output:**
+ 1. Behold the Empire State of Mind: ...
+ 2. Get Artsy-Fartsy at MoMA: ...
+ 3. Shop 'Til You Drop on Fifth Avenue: ...
+ 
+ ### Step-back Prompting
+ 
+ Encourages the model to consider a general question before a specific one.
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ 1. Ask: "What are 5 key settings for a first-person shooter video game?"
+ 2. Use the answer as context for: "Write a one paragraph storyline for a new level set in an underwater research facility."
+ 
+ ### Chain of Thought (CoT)
+ 
+ Instructs the model to reason step by step.
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ ```
+ When I was 3 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now, I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step by step.
+ ```
+ **Output:**
+ 1. When I was 3, my partner was 9.
+ 2. Now I am 20, so 17 years have passed.
+ 3. My partner is now 9 + 17 = 26 years old.
+ 
+ ### Self-consistency
+ 
+ Run the same prompt multiple times with high temperature, then select the most common answer.
+ 
+ ### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
+ 
+ Allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, not just a single chain.
+ 
+ ### ReAct (Reason & Act)
+ 
+ Combines reasoning with actions, such as using external tools or APIs.
+ 
+ **Example:**
+ - The model reasons about a problem, performs a search, updates its reasoning, and repeats until a solution is found.
+ 
+ ### Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE)
+ 
+ Automates the creation and evaluation of prompts by having the model generate and score prompt variants.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Code Prompting
+ 
+ ### Writing Code
+ 
+ **Prompt:**
+ ```
+ Write a code snippet in Bash, which asks for a folder name. Then it takes the contents of the folder and renames all the files inside by prepending the name draft to the file name.
+ ```
+ **Output:**
+ ```bash
+ #!/bin/bash
+ echo "Enter the folder name:"
+ read folder_name
+ if [ ! -d "$folder_name" ]; then
+   echo "Folder does not exist."
+   exit 1
+ fi
+ files=("$folder_name"/*)
+ for file in "${files[@]}"; do
+   new_file_name="draft_$(basename "$file")"
+   mv "$file" "$new_file_name"
+ done
+ echo "Files renamed successfully."
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Explaining Code
+ 
+ **Prompt:**
+ ```
+ Explain to me the below Bash code:
+ #!/bin/bash
+ echo "Enter the folder name:"
+ read folder_name
+ ...
+ ```
+ **Output:**
+ 1. Prompts the user for a folder name.
+ 2. Checks if the folder exists.
+ 3. Lists files and renames them with a prefix.
+ 4. Prints a success message.
+ 
+ ### Translating Code
+ 
+ **Prompt:**
+ ```
+ Translate the below Bash code to a Python snippet.
+ ...
+ ```
+ **Output:**
  ```python
  import os
  import shutil
- # Get the folder name from the user
  folder_name = input("Enter the folder name: ")
- prefix = input("Enter the string to prepend to the filename: ")
- text = prefix.upper()
- # Check if the folder exists
  if not os.path.isdir(folder_name):
      print("Folder does not exist.")
      exit(1)
- # Get a list of all files in the folder
  files = os.listdir(folder_name)
- # Iterate over the files
  for file in files:
-  # Create a new file name with the prefix "draft_"
-  new_filename = f"{text}_{file}"
- # Move the file to the new name
- shutil.move(os.path.join(folder_name, file),
- Continues next page...
- 
- **PAGE 52**

- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 52
- Output os.path.join(folder_name, new_filename))
- # Print a success message
+     new_file_name = f"draft_{file}"
+     shutil.move(os.path.join(folder_name, file), os.path.join(folder_name, new_file_name))
  print("Files renamed successfully.")
- ````
- 
- Additionally, there are a few other improvements that can be made to the code:
- 
- 1.  The file extension of the new filenames is not kept.
-     It’s better to extract the
-     extension from the original filename and append it to the new filename.
- 2.  The code assumes that there are no spaces in the folder name.
-     However,
-     it is a good practice to handle spaces gracefully by replacing them with
-     underscores or hyphens.
- 3.  Using the `f` string syntax for string interpolation is more readable and
-     concise than the traditional `+` operator.
- 4.  The code doesn’t handle errors that might occur during the renaming process.
-     It would be better to wrap the `shutil.move` call in a `try...except` block to
-     catch any potential errors.
-     Here is the improved code with these suggestions:
- 
- <!-- end list -->
- 
- ```python
- import os
- import shutil
- # Get the folder name from the user
- folder_name = input("Enter the folder name: ")
- prefix = input("Enter the string to prepend to the filename: ")
- # Check if the folder exists
- if not os.path.isdir(folder_name):
-  print("Folder does not exist.")
-  exit(1)
- # Get a list of all files in the folder
- files = os.listdir(folder_name)
- # Iterate over the files
- for file in files:
- Continues next page...
- 
- **PAGE 53**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 53
- Output # Get the file extension
-  ext = os.path.splitext(file)[1]
- # Create a new file name with the prefix and the file extension
-  new_filename = f"{prefix}_{os.path.splitext(file)[0]}{ext}"
- # Build the full paths for the original and new files
-  old_path = os.path.join(folder_name, file)
-  new_path = os.path.join(folder_name, new_filename)
- # Try to move the file
-  try:
-  shutil.move(old_path, new_path)
- except Exception as e:
-  print(f"An error occurred while moving the file
- {file}: {e}")
- # Print a success message
- print("Files renamed successfully.")
- ```
- 
- These improvements make the code more robust and flexible while also making
- it easier to read and understand... (The response was truncated because
- it has reached the token limit. Try to increase
- the token limit if you need a
- longer response.)
- Table 19. A prompt for debugging and reviewing Python code
- That’s great.
- Not only did it tell me how to solve the problem, it also figured out that my code
- had more bugs and how to solve them, too.
- The last part of the prompt gave suggestions to
- improve the code in general.

- What about multimodal prompting?
- Prompting for code still uses the same regular large language model.
- Multimodal prompting
- is a separate concern, it refers to a technique where you use multiple input formats to guide
- a large language model, instead of just relying on text.
- This can include combinations of text,
- images, audio, code, or even other formats, depending on the model’s capabilities and the
- task at hand.
- Best Practices
- Finding the right prompt requires tinkering. Language Studio in Vertex AI is a perfect place to
- play around with your prompts, with the ability to test against the various models.
- Use the following best practices to become a pro in prompt engineering.
- Provide examples
- The most important best practice is to provide (one shot / few shot) examples within a
- prompt.
- This is highly effective because it acts as a powerful teaching tool.
- These examples
- showcase desired outputs or similar responses, allowing the model to learn from them
- and tailor its own generation accordingly.
- It’s like giving the model a reference point or
- target to aim for, improving the accuracy, style, and tone of its response to better match
- your expectations.
- 
- **PAGE 55**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 55
- Design with simplicity
- Prompts should be concise, clear, and easy to understand for both you and the model.
- As a
- rule of thumb, if it’s already confusing for you it will likely be also confusing for the model.
- Try
- not to use complex language and don’t provide unnecessary information.
- Examples:
- BEFORE:
- I am visiting New York right now, and I'd like to hear more about great
- locations.
- I am with two 3 year old kids. Where should we go during
- our vacation?
- AFTER REWRITE:
- Act as a travel guide for tourists. Describe great places to visit in
- New York Manhattan with a 3 year old.
- Try using verbs that describe the action. Here’s a set of examples:
- Act, Analyze, Categorize, Classify, Contrast, Compare, Create, Describe, Define,
- Evaluate, Extract, Find, Generate, Identify, List, Measure, Organize, Parse, Pick,
- Predict, Provide, Rank, Recommend, Return, Retrieve, Rewrite, Select, Show, Sort,
- Summarize, Translate, Write.
- 
- **PAGE 56**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 56
- Be specific about the output
- Be specific about the desired output.
- A concise instruction might not guide the LLM enough
- or could be too generic.
- Providing specific details in the prompt (through system or context
- prompting) can help the model to focus on what’s relevant, improving the overall accuracy.
- Examples:
- DO:
- Generate a 3 paragraph blog post about the top 5 video game consoles.
- The blog post should be informative and engaging, and it should be
- written in a conversational style.
- DO NOT:
- Generate a blog post about video game consoles.
- Use Instructions over Constraints
- Instructions and constraints are used in prompting to guide the output of a LLM.
- • An instruction provides explicit instructions on the desired format, style, or content of the
- response.
- It guides the model on what the model should do or produce.
- • A constraint is a set of limitations or boundaries on the response.
- It limits what the model
- should not do or avoid.
- 
- **PAGE 57**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 57
- Growing research suggests that focusing on positive instructions in prompting can be more
- effective than relying heavily on constraints.
- This approach aligns with how humans prefer
- positive instructions over lists of what not to do.
- Instructions directly communicate the desired outcome, whereas constraints might leave the
- model guessing about what is allowed.
- It gives flexibility and encourages creativity within the
- defined boundaries, while constraints can limit the model’s potential.
- Also a list of constraints
- can clash with each other.
- Constraints are still valuable but in certain situations.
- To prevent the model from generating
- harmful or biased content or when a strict output format or style is needed.
- If possible, use positive instructions: instead of telling the model what not to do, tell it what to
- do instead.
- This can avoid confusion and improve the accuracy of the output.
- DO:
- Generate a 1 paragraph blog post about the top 5 video game consoles.
- Only discuss the console, the company who made it, the year, and total
- sales.
- DO NOT:
- Generate a 1 paragraph blog post about the top 5 video game consoles.
- Do not list video game names.
- As a best practice, start by prioritizing instructions, clearly stating what you want the model
- to do and only use constraints when necessary for safety, clarity or specific requirements.
- Experiment and iterate to test different combinations of instructions and constraints to find
- what works best for your specific tasks, and document these.

- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 58
- Control the max token length
- To control the length of a generated LLM response, you can either set a max token limit in the
- configuration or explicitly request a specific length in your prompt.
- For example:
- "Explain quantum physics in a tweet length message."
- Use variables in prompts
- To reuse prompts and make it more dynamic use variables in the prompt, which can be
- changed for different inputs.
- E.g. as shown in Table 20, a prompt which gives facts about a
- city.
- Instead of hardcoding the city name in the prompt, use a variable.
- Variables can save
- you time and effort by allowing you to avoid repeating yourself.
- If you need to use the same
- piece of information in multiple prompts, you can store it in a variable and then reference
- that variable in each prompt.
- This makes a lot of sense when integrating prompts into your
- own applications.
- Prompt VARIABLES
- {city} = "Amsterdam"
- PROMPT
- You are a travel guide.
- Tell me a fact about the city: {city}
- Output Amsterdam is a beautiful city full of canals, bridges, and narrow streets.
- It’s a
- great place to visit for its rich history, culture, and nightlife.
- Table 20. Using variables in prompts

- **PAGE 59**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 59
- Experiment with input formats and writing styles
- Different models, model configurations, prompt formats, word choices, and submits can yield
- different results.
- Therefore, it’s important to experiment with prompt attributes like the style,
- the word choice, and the type prompt (zero shot, few shot, system prompt).
- For example a prompt with the goal to generate text about the revolutionary video game
- console Sega Dreamcast, can be formulated as a question, a statement or an instruction,
- resulting in different outputs:
- • Question: What was the Sega Dreamcast and why was it such a revolutionary console?
- • Statement: The Sega Dreamcast was a sixth-generation video game console released by
- Sega in 1999. It...
- • Instruction: Write a single paragraph that describes the Sega Dreamcast console and
- explains why it was so revolutionary.
- For few-shot prompting with classification tasks, mix up
- the classes
- Generally speaking, the order of your few-shots examples should not matter much.
- However,
- when doing classification tasks, make sure you mix up the possible response classes in the
- few shot examples.
- This is because you might otherwise be overfitting to the specific order of
- the examples.
- By mixing up the possible response classes, you can ensure that the model is
- learning to identify the key features of each class, rather than simply memorizing the order of
- the examples.
- This will lead to more robust and generalizable performance on unseen data.
- 
- **PAGE 60**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 60
- A good rule of thumb is to start with 6 few shot examples and start testing the accuracy
- from there.
- Adapt to model updates
- It’s important for you to stay on top of model architecture changes, added data, and
- capabilities.
- Try out newer model versions and adjust your prompts to better leverage new
- model features.
- Tools like Vertex AI Studio are great to store, test, and document the various
- versions of your prompt.
- Experiment with output formats
- Besides the prompt input format, consider experimenting with the output format.
- For non-
- creative tasks like extracting, selecting, parsing, ordering, ranking, or categorizing data try
- having your output returned in a structured format like JSON or XML.
- There are some benefits in returning JSON objects from a prompt that extracts data.
- In
- a real-world application I don’t need to manually create this JSON format, I can already
- return the data in a sorted order (very handy when working with datetime objects), but most
- importantly, by prompting for a JSON format it forces the model to create a structure and
- limit hallucinations.
- Table 4 in the few-shot prompting section shows an example on how to return
- structured output.

- Experiment together with other prompt engineers
- If you are in a situation where you have to try to come up with a good prompt, you might
- want to find multiple people to make an attempt.
- When everyone follows the best practices
- (as listed in this chapter) you are going to see a variance in performance between all the
- different prompt attempts.
- CoT Best practices
- For CoT prompting, putting the answer after the reasoning is required because the
- generation of the reasoning changes the tokens that the model gets when it predicts the
- final answer.
- With CoT and self-consistency you need to be able to extract the final answer from your
- prompt, separated from the reasoning.
- For CoT prompting, set the temperature to 0.
- Chain of thought prompting is based on greedy decoding, predicting the next word in a
- sequence based on the highest probability assigned by the language model.
- Generally
- speaking, when using reasoning, to come up with the final answer, there’s likely one single
- correct answer.
- Therefore the temperature should always set to 0.
- 
- **PAGE 62**
- 
- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 62
- Document the various prompt attempts
- The last tip was mentioned before in this chapter, but we can’t stress enough how important
- it is: document your prompt attempts in full detail so you can learn over time what went well
- and what did not.
- Prompt outputs can differ across models, across sampling settings, and even across different
- versions of the same model.
- Moreover, even across identical prompts to the same model,
- small differences in output sentence formatting and word choice can occur.
- (For example, as
- mentioned previously, if two tokens have the same predicted probability, ties may be broken
- randomly. This can then impact subsequent predicted tokens.).
- We recommend creating a Google Sheet with Table 21 as a template.
- The advantages of
- this approach are that you have a complete record when you inevitably have to revisit your
- prompting work–either to pick it up in the future (you’d be surprised how much you can
- forget after just a short break), to test prompt performance on different versions of a model,
- and to help debug future errors.
- Beyond the fields in this table, it’s also helpful to track the version of the prompt (iteration),
- a field to capture if the result was OK/NOT OK/SOMETIMES OK, and a field to capture
- feedback.
- If you’re lucky enough to be using Vertex AI Studio, save your prompts (using the
- same name and version as listed in your documentation) and track the hyperlink to the saved
- prompt in the table.
- This way, you’re always one click away from re-running your prompts.
- When working on a retrieval augmented generation system, you should also capture the
- specific aspects of the RAG system that impact what content was inserted into the prompt,
- including the query, chunk settings, chunk output, and other information.
- 
- **PAGE 63**

- Prompt Engineering
- September 2024 63
- Once you feel the prompt is close to perfect, take it to your project codebase.
- And in the
- codebase, save prompts in a separate file from code, so it’s easier to maintain.
- Finally, ideally
- your prompts are part of an operationalized system, and as a prompt engineer you should
- rely on automated tests and evaluation procedures to understand how well your prompt
- generalizes to a task.
- Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Craft and test different prompts, analyze,
- and document the results.
- Refine your prompt based on the model’s performance. Keep
- experimenting until you achieve the desired output.
- When you change a model or model
- configuration, go back and keep experimenting with the previously used prompts.
- Name [name and version of your prompt]

@models.md @paymentsaijam.md @promptengwp.md @proposal.md Move these files to a new folder called "context"

Then summarize each file (exception proposal.md) so that they can be relevant for generating a schedule and curriculum that @proposal.md proposes and I will use for @schedule.md 

---

_**Assistant**_

_****_

Okay, I can do that. I will first create the `context` directory and move the files into it.



---

_****_

```bash
mv proposal.md context/
```

```
➜  aibootcamp mv proposal.md context/
mv: rename proposal.md to context/: No such file or directory
?➜  aibootcamp
```

---

_****_

It seems the `context` directory doesn't exist yet. I'll create it first.



---

_****_

```bash
mkdir context
```

```
?➜  aibootcamp 

```

---

_****_

Now I'll move the files.


---

_****_

```bash
mv models.md paymentsaijam.md promptengwp.md proposal.md context/
```

```
?➜  aibootcamp

Here are the summaries relevant for generating the schedule and curriculum proposed in `proposal.md`:

**`models.md` Summary:**

*   **Core Concept:** Provides a comparative analysis of major LLMs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere) as of early 2025, focusing on their strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs for software engineering tasks.
*   **Curriculum Relevance:**
    *   **Model Selection:** Details which models excel at specific tasks (coding, reasoning, large context, speed, cost). This informs which models to use or teach for different bootcamp activities (e.g., planning vs. implementation).
    *   **Tool Integration:** Highlights integration with IDEs like Cursor, including features like MAX context modes and agent capabilities. This is crucial for the hands-on labs.
    *   **Practical Guidance:** Offers tips on effective prompting and mitigating limitations (hallucinations, context issues, cost). This can be directly incorporated into teaching materials.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Explains modality, context windows, reasoning, and tool use, which are foundational concepts for Day 1.

**`paymentsaijam.md` Summary:**

*   **Core Concept:** Details lessons learned from a 4-day AI workshop focused on integrating AI into complex engineering workflows (legacy code, planning, implementation). Key discovery is the "Clarity Spectrum."
*   **Curriculum Relevance:**
    *   **The Clarity Spectrum:** Introduces a framework for understanding how to use AI effectively based on the level of problem/solution clarity (Exploratory Uncertainty vs. Implementation Clarity). This is a central theme for Day 1 and Day 2, informing how to teach navigating code and planning.
    *   **Effective Techniques:** Outlines successful patterns like "Context Shedding," "Comparative Learning," and "Manual Context Management," which are practical skills to teach during workshops.
    *   **Challenges & Mitigation:** Discusses real-world problems like hallucinations, dead code, and error loops, providing context for teaching validation, prompt refinement, and structured approaches (e.g., skeleton code).
    *   **Productivity Gains:** Provides evidence (5x delivery, 8x planning) that motivates the bootcamp and reinforces the value proposition.
    *   **Onboarding:** Notes faster onboarding for junior engineers, relevant to the bootcamp's goal of scaling skills.

**`promptengwp.md` Summary:**

*   **Core Concept:** A comprehensive whitepaper on prompt engineering techniques, LLM configurations, code-specific prompting, and best practices.
*   **Curriculum Relevance:**
    *   **Prompting Techniques:** Explains foundational techniques like Zero-shot, Few-shot, System/Role/Contextual prompting, Chain of Thought (CoT), ReAct, etc. These form the core of prompt engineering training (Day 1 & 2).
    *   **LLM Configuration:** Covers Temperature, Top-K, Top-P, which are essential for the Day 1 "LLM Foundations" activity.
    *   **Code Prompting:** Provides specific examples for writing, explaining, translating, and debugging code using prompts – directly applicable to Day 3 "BUILD" labs.
    *   **Best Practices:** Lists actionable advice (Provide Examples, Be Specific, Use Instructions over Constraints, Document Attempts) that should be woven throughout the bootcamp curriculum.
    *   **Structured Examples:** The format used in the whitepaper (Goal, Model, Config, Prompt, Output tables) can serve as a template for the "Prompt Log" deliverables mentioned in the pre-bootcamp requirements and daily activities.

These summaries should provide the necessary context from the supporting documents to flesh out the schedule and curriculum detailed in `schedule.md` based on the goals outlined in `proposal.md`.
