## Bootcamp Requirements and Schedule Planning (4/20/2025, 1:15:13 PM)

_**User**_

Create a new file that tracks all the requirements of the bootcamp. 

- It needs to run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
- Lunch starts at 11:30 a.m. or noon
- Hands on workshop is important with TA's floating around. 

The output I need:
1. Schedule of the bootcamp
2. The curriculum and detailed information about each session (presentation or activity or workshop/lab)
3. Information I need to send out to the managers and the participants

I have created the file `bootcamp_requirements.md` with the structure and initial information based on your request. It includes sections for the core requirements, a proposed schedule outline, placeholders for the detailed curriculum, and templates for communication materials.

You can now start filling in the specifics for the curriculum and refining the communication drafts in this file.

---

_**User**_

The output I need:
1. Schedule of the bootcamp (schedule.md)
2. The curriculum and detailed information about each session (presentation or activity or workshop/lab) (a subdirectory that has files that the schedule will reference)
3. Information I need to send out to the managers and the participants (another file that keeps track of what I have already communicated and what I need to going forward.)

Make sure the output files are present and they are being tracked in a separate directory. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I understand. You want to break down the information from `bootcamp_requirements.md` into a more structured format with separate files for the schedule, curriculum details (in a subdirectory), and communication tracking, all within a new directory.

I will create the following structure:

```
bootcamp_materials/
├── schedule.md
├── communications.md
└── curriculum/
    └── placeholder.md  # Placeholder to create the directory
```

Then I will populate `schedule.md` and `communications.md` based on the content previously generated.

First, I'll create the main directory and the curriculum subdirectory with a placeholder file.


---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ # Placeholder for curriculum details
+ 
+ Details about specific sessions will go in files within this directory. 
```

---

_****_

Now, I'll create the `schedule.md` file.


---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ # Bootcamp Schedule
+ 
+ *   **9:00 AM - 9:15 AM:** Welcome & Daily Overview
+ *   **9:15 AM - 11:30 AM / 12:00 PM:** Morning Session ([Details TBD](./curriculum/placeholder.md))
+ *   **11:30 AM / 12:00 PM - 12:30 PM / 1:00 PM:** Lunch Break
+ *   **12:30 PM / 1:00 PM - 4:45 PM:** Afternoon Session ([Details TBD](./curriculum/placeholder.md))
+ *   **4:45 PM - 5:00 PM:** Daily Wrap-up & Q&A
+ 
+ *(Note: Exact timings and links to specific curriculum files need to be updated as the curriculum is finalized.)* 
```

---

I have created the `bootcamp_materials` directory and the following files within it:

1.  `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md`: Contains the schedule outline with placeholder links to the curriculum directory.
2.  `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/placeholder.md`: A placeholder file within the curriculum directory. You should replace this and add new markdown files here for each session/module, detailing the content (presentation, activity, lab), and then update the links in `schedule.md`.
3.  `bootcamp_materials/communications.md`: Contains the communication templates for managers and participants, along with a table to log sent communications.

The original `bootcamp_requirements.md` file still exists. You may want to update it to point to this new structure or remove it if it's now redundant.

_**User**_

Review all the files in the project and understand them. 

Review @schedule.md and see whether it fulfills requirements. Suggest improvements@context @bootcamp_requirements.md 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I will review the project files, focusing on `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md` and comparing it against the requirements outlined in `bootcamp_requirements.md` and the detailed content implied by the files in the `context` directory.

Based on the files provided:

*   `bootcamp_requirements.md`: Outlines the high-level requirements (9-5 schedule, lunch, hands-on format).
*   `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md`: Contains a detailed 3-day schedule with specific timings, topics, talks, activities, and labs.
*   `bootcamp_materials/communications.md`: Holds communication templates and a log.
*   `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/placeholder.md`: A placeholder for detailed session content.
*   `context/` directory files (`slack.md`, `emails.md`, `paymentsaijam.md`, `promptengwp.md`, `models.md`, `proposal.md`): Seem to contain supporting materials, communication drafts, and potentially deep dives into specific topics (like Payments AI Jam, Prompt Engineering, Models) that likely form the basis of the curriculum mentioned in the schedule.

**Review of `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md`:**

The current `schedule.md` is quite detailed and seems to map out a comprehensive 3-day AI bootcamp.

**Comparison against `bootcamp_requirements.md`:**

1.  **Schedule (9 a.m. - 5 p.m.):** Yes, the schedule generally adheres to this timeframe, starting at 8:45/9:00 AM and ending around 5:00 PM each day.
2.  **Lunch (11:30 a.m. or noon):** Yes, lunch breaks are scheduled consistently around 12:00 PM or 12:15 PM.
3.  **Hands-on Workshop/Labs with TA Support:** Yes, the schedule explicitly includes multiple "Workshop" and "Lab" sessions (e.g., "Map a Service You Don’t Know", "Planning Workshop", "AI Implementation, Test-Driven", "Debug a Real... Error", "Try Agent Mode"). The staff list includes TAs, fulfilling the support requirement.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Link Curriculum Details:** The schedule currently lists session titles and types (Talk, Activity, Lab) but doesn't link to detailed descriptions. The requirement was to have a subdirectory with files referenced by the schedule.
    *   **Action:** Create individual markdown files within the `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/` directory for each major Talk, Activity, Workshop, or Lab. For example:
        *   `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/day1_llm_foundations.md`
        *   `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/day1_navigator_pattern.md`
        *   `bootcamp_materials/curriculum/day1_workshop_map_service.md`
        *   etc...
    *   **Action:** Update `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md` to link to these specific files instead of the generic placeholder. E.g., `[LLM Foundations, Hallucinations & Observing AI Behavior](./curriculum/day1_llm_foundations.md)`
2.  **Consolidate Pre-Bootcamp Info:** The "Pre-Bootcamp Requirements" are currently listed directly in the schedule. This might be better placed in the participant communication (`communications.md`) or a dedicated "Preparation" document linked from both the schedule and communications.
3.  **Clarify Deliverables:** Some sessions list deliverables (e.g., "3 prompt-log entries", "Post `architecture.md`"). Ensure these are consistently formatted and clear. You might consider a dedicated section or document summarizing all deliverables.
4.  **Remove Day 0 Staff Prep:** The "Day 0 (T‑1): Onsite Staff Preparation" might not be relevant for the participant-facing schedule. Consider moving this to internal planning documents.
5.  **Refine Optional Session:** Clarify if the "Optional Hack & Snack" is truly optional or if participation is encouraged/expected for certain outcomes.

Would you like me to start implementing suggestion #1 by creating the curriculum files and updating the links in `schedule.md`?

+ # Day 2: Talk/Demo: Guiding the Planner – Context & Feedback Loops
+ 
+ **Type:** Talk & Demo
+ 
+ **Time:** 10:30 - 11:30
+ 
+ **Goal:** Emphasize the engineer's role as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) when using AI for planning, focusing on providing effective context and utilizing feedback loops.
+ 
+ **Key Concepts:**
+ *   **Engineer as SME:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for domain knowledge and critical thinking.
+ *   **Importance of Feedback:** Planning is iterative; AI suggestions need validation and refinement through engineer feedback.
+ *   **Providing Effective Context:** Techniques to give the AI the necessary background information:
+     *   Attaching relevant documentation (`@file` docs).
+     *   Including relevant code snippets (`@file` code).
+     *   Specifying business rules or constraints.
+     *   Using `.cursorignore` to exclude irrelevant files/directories.
+     *   Mental Context Priming (MCP): Briefly summarizing key context directly in the prompt even if files are attached.
+ *   **Feedback Loops:** Demonstrating how to use AI's initial plan/output as a starting point and iteratively refine it with corrective or guiding prompts.
+ 
+ **Demo:** Showcasing good vs. bad context provision for a planning prompt. Demonstrating a short feedback loop where an initial AI suggestion is refined based on engineer input.
+ 
+ **Details:**
+ 
+ *(Add examples of good/bad context prompts, link to `.cursorignore` documentation, sample feedback loop prompts)*

+ # Day 2: Talk: AI-Driven Planning, Unknowns → Rough ERD
+ 
+ **Type:** Talk
+ 
+ **Time:** 09:30 - 10:15
+ 
+ **Goal:** Introduce the basic concepts of using AI in the early stages of project planning and design, focusing on identifying unknowns and generating initial data models.
+ 
+ **Key Concepts:**
+ *   **Basic AI Planning Loop:** Frame the problem -> Prompt AI -> Analyze output -> Refine prompt/plan -> Repeat.
+ *   **Instacart Apple Pay Story:** Use case example illustrating how AI can help uncover requirements or potential issues early.
+ *   **Techniques for Early Planning:**
+     *   **Identifying Unknowns:** Prompting AI with questions like "What information is missing?", "What assumptions are being made?", "What are the key dependencies?".
+     *   **Generating Rough ERDs:** Prompting AI to suggest a preliminary Entity-Relationship Diagram based on a high-level description of requirements (e.g., "Draft a simple ERD for a user profile system with posts and comments"). Focus on relationships and key attributes, not exhaustive detail.
+ 
+ **Emphasis:** AI is a brainstorming partner and helps structure initial thoughts, but requires human validation and refinement.
+ 
+ **Details:**
+ 
+ *(Add link to Instacart story if available, specific prompt examples for identifying unknowns and generating ERDs)*

+ # Day 3: Lab: AI Implementation, Test-Driven
+ 
+ **Type:** Lab
+ 
+ **Time:** 09:40–10:40
+ 
+ **Goal:** Practice using AI for code implementation following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
+ 
+ **Starter:**
+ *   Checkout a specific development branch (in participant's repo or provided).
+ *   This branch contains 2+ failing tests related to a specific feature/bug fix (or a provided ticket detailing the required change and tests).
+

+ 2.  **Write Minimal Skeleton:** Manually write the basic function/class structure needed to make the code compile/run, even if tests still fail.
+ 3.  **Use AI to Implement Logic:** Prompt the AI (e.g., Cursor) to fill in the implementation details within the skeleton, specifically instructing it to make the failing tests pass.
+     *   Provide context: `@file` the relevant test file(s) and the skeleton code file.
+     *   Clearly state the goal: "Implement the logic in `function_name` to make the tests in `test_file.py` pass."
+ 4.  **Run Tests:** Check if tests now pass.
+ 5.  **Iterate:** If tests fail, provide the error output back to the AI and ask for corrections. Refine the code manually if needed.
+ 6.  **Refactor (Optional):** Once tests are green, consider asking the AI for refactoring suggestions or manually improving the code.
+ 
+ **Deliverable:**
+ *   Key prompts used for the main implementation and any error fixing logged in prompt log.
+ *   Code committed to the branch with tests passing.
+ 
+ **Stretch Goals:**
+ *   Get Continuous Integration (CI) checks to pass on push (if applicable).
+ *   Attempt a multi-file refactor using AI assistance.
+ *   Use AI to generate *new* tests for the implemented code.

+ **Goal:** Introduce best practices for managing AI context within the Cursor environment, focusing on rules and intentional context selection.
+ 
+ **Key Concepts:**
+ *   **Context is King (and Queen):** Reiterate that the quality and relevance of context provided to the AI dramatically impacts output quality.
+ *   **Cursor Rules:**
+     *   Purpose: Define reusable sets of files/symbols to quickly provide relevant context for specific tasks (e.g., a rule for "API Authentication" might include auth middleware, user models, relevant controllers).
+     *   Creating Rules: How to define rules in Cursor settings.
+     *   Using Rules: Applying rules via `@rule_name` in prompts.
+ *   **Context Hygiene:** Practices for keeping context focused and relevant:
+     *   Using `.cursorignore`: Explicitly telling Cursor to ignore certain files/directories (logs, build artifacts, large vendor libs) to save tokens and reduce noise.
+     *   Focusing Code Selection: Intentionally using `@file` or selecting specific code blocks rather than relying on broad context.
+     *   Clearing Chat History: Starting fresh chats for unrelated tasks to avoid context bleed.
+ *   **Quick Agent Safety Tips (Preview):** Briefly mention how good context hygiene is even *more* critical for Agent mode (covered later).

I want Day 1 to have presentations on:
- LLM Foundations, Hallucinations, Observing AI behavior
- Understanding different Models and their characteristics
- Gaining an intuition on AI behavior
- Map a Service You Don't Know should be a 90 minute exercise and the only workshop on day 1 other than maybe small labs or workshops of 20 minutes or less. 

Modify all curriculum and other days appropriately to accomplish the above

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I understand. You want to restructure Day 1 to focus on specific presentations and shorten the main workshop, moving the "Models" discussion from Day 2 to Day 1, and adjusting the rest of the schedule accordingly.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Rename & Modify Day 1 LLM Foundations:** Rename `day1_llm_foundations_activity.md` to `day1_llm_foundations_behavior.md`. Update its content to be primarily a presentation, potentially keeping a very short (<20 min) activity focused on observing behavior/intuition. Adjust timing.
2.  **Move Models Talk:** Delete the Day 2 Models talk file (`day2_model_choice_planning.md`) and create a new file for Day 1 (`day1_models_characteristics.md`), adapting the content.
3.  **Shorten Day 1 Workshop:** Modify `day1_workshop_map_service.md` to be 90 minutes long, adjusting its activities and deliverables.
4.  **Update Schedule:** Modify `bootcamp_materials/schedule.md` to reflect these changes:
    *   Insert the "Models Characteristics" presentation into Day 1.
    *   Adjust the timing and description of the "LLM Foundations & Behavior" session.
    *   Change the "Map a Service" workshop to 90 minutes.
    *   Remove the "Model Choice" talk from Day 2.
    *   Adjust timings on Day 2 to account for the removed session.
    *   Update all relevant links.

Let's start by renaming the LLM Foundations file. (Note: File renaming isn't directly possible, so I'll achieve this by creating the new file with the content and then deleting the old one.)

**Step 1: Create `day1_llm_foundations_behavior.md` (based on old content)**

All modifications are complete.

Summary of changes:

*   **Day 1:**
    *   Renamed and revised "LLM Foundations" to include a short lab focused on intuition (09:30-10:45).
    *   Added a new "Understanding Model Characteristics" presentation (10:45-11:15).
    *   Shortened the "Map a Service You Don't Know" workshop to 90 minutes (13:30-15:00) with adjusted deliverables.
    *   The afternoon slot after the break (15:15-16:45) is now designated as "Open Lab / Office Hours / Catch-up" to provide flexibility, TA support, and accommodate the shorter main workshop.
    *   Minor timing shifts for breaks and lunch.
*   **Day 2:**
    *   Removed the "Model Choice for Planning Tasks" talk.
    *   Slightly extended the "Advanced AI Planning Patterns" talk and the "Planning Workshop" to utilize the freed-up time.
    *   Adjusted timings for the afternoon break and share-out session.
*   **Curriculum Files:**
    *   `day1_llm_foundations_activity.md` deleted.
    *   `day1_llm_foundations_behavior.md` created/updated.
    *   `day2_model_choice_planning.md` deleted.
    *   `day1_models_characteristics.md` created.
    *   `day1_workshop_map_service.md` updated (time, activities, deliverables).
*   **Links:** All links in `schedule.md` pointing to Day 1 and Day 2 curriculum files have been updated. (It seems the previous attempt to update Day 3 links also went through, as the edit shows them already present).

The schedule and corresponding curriculum files should now reflect your requested Day 1 structure.

_**User**_

Add to the first day prompt strategies. @promptengwp.md We have enough time in the afternoon for it. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, let's add a session on Prompt Strategies to Day 1 afternoon, drawing content from the `promptengwp.md` whitepaper. We can replace a portion of the "Open Lab / Office Hours" time with this presentation. I'll aim for roughly a 60-minute session.

Mini-Talk: Providing Effective Feedback to AI is unnecessary and the workshop should come after the prompting strategy presentation

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I understand. We'll remove the "Providing Effective Feedback" mini-talk and reschedule the "Map a Service" workshop to occur after the "Prompting Strategies" presentation.

Here's the revised plan:

1.  **Delete `day1_minitalk_feedback.md`.**
2.  **Rearrange Day 1 Afternoon Schedule in `schedule.md`:**
    *   Move "Effective Prompting Strategies" presentation immediately after lunch.
    *   Place the "Map a Service" workshop after a break following the presentation.
    *   Adjust the final "Open Lab/Q&A" block.
3.  **Update timings in the affected curriculum files.**

All schedule and curriculum file timings for Day 1 have been updated to reflect the Kickoff session being extended to 30 minutes.

---

_**User**_

Make sure all the sessions are in the interval of 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I will review the Day 1 schedule and adjust any sessions that do not have durations of 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes. Breaks and buffer times like "Tech Checks" or "Wrap-up" will remain as they are.

Reviewing the current Day 1 schedule:
*   10:00–10:30 — Kickoff (30 min) - OK
*   10:30–11:40 — LLM Foundations & Intuition (70 min) - **Needs adjustment**
*   11:40–12:25 — Model Characteristics (45 min) - OK
*   13:10–14:10 — Prompting Strategies (60 min) - OK
*   14:10–14:40 — Navigator Pattern (30 min) - OK
*   14:55–16:25 — Map Service Workshop (90 min) - OK

The "LLM Foundations & Gaining Intuition" session is currently 70 minutes. I will shorten it to **60 minutes**. This requires adjusting its end time and shifting all subsequent sessions 10 minutes earlier.

update @bootcamp_requirements.md based on the requirements from this conversation

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_****_

Okay, I will update `bootcamp_requirements.md` to reflect the detailed structure and content that has been developed in the `bootcamp_materials/` directory.

I'll replace the outdated schedule outline, curriculum placeholders, and communication templates with links to the new, more detailed files (`schedule.md`, `communications.md`, and the `curriculum/` directory). I'll keep the core requirements section as it reflects the foundational goals.


---

_****_



---

_****_

It seems the file might not have been updated correctly. Let me try reapplying the edit.


---

_****_



---

_****_

It seems there's an issue updating the `bootcamp_requirements.md` file directly. However, the intended content reflecting the current structure is:

```markdown
# Bootcamp Requirements & Planning

This document outlines the high-level requirements for the bootcamp. Detailed planning, schedule, curriculum, and communication materials are now maintained in the `bootcamp_materials/` directory.

## 1. Core Requirements

*   **Duration:** Runs daily, generally within the 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. timeframe (See detailed schedule for exact daily start/end times).
*   **Lunch Break:** Included daily (See detailed schedule).
*   **Format:** Emphasis on hands-on workshops and labs.
*   **Support:** Teaching Assistants (TAs) should be available during workshops to provide support.

## 2. Detailed Schedule

The detailed day-by-day schedule, including session timings and topics, can be found here:
[./bootcamp_materials/schedule.md](./bootcamp_materials/schedule.md)

## 3. Detailed Curriculum

Detailed information for each planned session (presentations, activities, workshops/labs) is maintained in individual files within this directory:
[./bootcamp_materials/curriculum/](./bootcamp_materials/curriculum/)

Links to specific curriculum files are included in the main schedule.

## 4. Communication Plan & Tracking

Communication templates (for managers, participants) and a log for tracking sent communications can be found here:
[./bootcamp_materials/communications.md](./bootcamp_materials/communications.md)

```

This revised content removes the outdated outlines and points directly to the detailed files created during our conversation.
