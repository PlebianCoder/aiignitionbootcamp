# AI Ignition Bootcamp: What's Next?

Thank you for participating in the AI Ignition Bootcamp! Your engagement and willingness to explore these new workflows are crucial as we integrate AI more deeply into our engineering practices.

This document outlines key resources, next steps, and expectations for continuing your AI journey and sharing your learnings.

## Philosophy Recap: Teach One, Train Many

As mentioned in the [Bootcamp Proposal](./../context/proposal.md), a core goal of this program is to empower you, the participants ("Culture Drivers"), to become AI advocates and educators within your own teams. You are now equipped to be **torchbearers**, multiplying the impact of this training across the organization.

## Immediate Next Steps (Your Action Items)

1.  **Apply Your Learnings:** Start integrating the techniques (Navigator Pattern, Planning Workflows, TDD with AI, Debugging Strategies) into your daily work *this week*. Practice is key!
2.  **Complete the Final Survey:** Your feedback is vital for improving future sessions. Please complete the survey shared during the wrap-up: `[Link to Final Survey - Placeholder]`
3.  **Share Key Takeaways:** Post at least one key learning, useful prompt, or successful application in the dedicated Slack channel: `#ai-ignition-bootcamp-learnings` (or specific location channel).
4.  **Plan Your Team Share-Out:** Begin thinking about how you will share key concepts and practical techniques from this bootcamp with your immediate team members within the next 1-2 sprints. (See Resources below).
5.  **Continue Prompt Logging:** Keep refining your personal prompt library. It's a valuable asset!
