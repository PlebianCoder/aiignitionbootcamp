## Content Outline

### 1. Recap: The Clarity Spectrum (5 mins)
- Briefly revisit the spectrum diagram (Uncertainty -> Emerging Clarity -> Implementation Clarity).
- Remind participants of Day 1 (Left Side - Discover) and Day 2 (Middle - Plan).
- Today's Focus: The "Right Side" - We have a plan, tasks are defined, requirements are clear. Now we build!

### 2. Why Precision Matters on the Right Side (10 mins)
- **Goal:** Minimize ambiguity for the AI. Clear requirements demand precise execution.
- **Reduced Tolerance for Hallucinations:** Unlike exploration, errors here are bugs, not discovery prompts. (`paymentsaijam.md`)
- **AI as an Amplifier:** AI amplifies *your* clarity. Precise inputs yield precise outputs. Vague inputs yield vague (or wrong) outputs. (`paymentsaijam.md`, `implementation.md` - II.A)
- **Efficiency:** Less back-and-forth, fewer error loops when instructions are unambiguous. (`implementation.md` - V.A)
- **Model Choice for Implementation:** While Day 1 discussed general model characteristics, for the *implementation* tasks today (Right Side), consider models often cited for strong coding performance and adherence to instructions. Examples based on `implementation.md` (Sec II.C) and user reports include:
    - *Primary Choices:* Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet (Standard)
    - *Strong Alternatives:* Gemini 2.5 Pro (exp), certain specialized OpenAI models (e.g., o3-mini-high if available and given full context).
    - *Planning/Reasoning Models (Less Ideal for Direct Build):* Models focused heavily on reasoning (like Claude 3.7 MAX or potentially higher-tier GPT/o-series mentioned for reasoning) might be overkill or less stable for direct code generation from specific instructions.
    - *Key:* Experiment, but lean towards models known for reliable code output during the BUILD phase.

### 3. Key BUILD Phase Techniques (15 mins)
- **Technique 1: Focused Context Provisioning** (`implementation.md` - III.C, VII.C)
    - Shift from broad `@Codebase` (exploration) to specific `@file`, `@symbol`, `@Doc`, `@Rule`.
    - Only provide *exactly* what's needed for the task.
    - Demo: Contrasting a vague prompt with a focused prompt for a simple function implementation.
- **Technique 2: Small Incremental Steps** (`implementation.md` - IV.B)
    - Implement tasks chunk by chunk (e.g., function by function, test case by test case).
    - Easier to review, debug, and keep AI focused. Limits the blast radius of errors.
    - Reinforces the idea of building blocks based on the plan.
- **Technique 3: Diligent Review & Validation** (`implementation.md` - IV.A)
    - **NEVER blindly accept AI code.** Treat it as a code review from a junior dev.
    - **Diff Review:** Meticulously check additions *and* deletions. Did it delete something important?
    - **Ask for Reasoning:** Use prompts like "Explain this code" or "Why did you choose this approach?" to uncover flawed logic. (`implementation.md` - IV.A)
    - Connect to upcoming TDD session: Tests are the ultimate validation.

### 4. Context Hygiene for BUILD (10 mins)
- **Shedding Planning Context:** Start new chats/sessions for implementation tasks. Don't carry over the potentially "polluted" context from broad planning discussions. (`paymentsaijam.md` - Context Shedding, `implementation.md` - V.A)
- **Why?** Prevents AI from reverting to old assumptions, getting confused by extensive history, or exceeding context limits. (`implementation.md` - VIII.A)
- **Practical Tip:** Name your chats clearly (e.g., "Implement Task #123", "Debug User Login").
- **Using `.cursorignore**:** Recap its importance for keeping the AI focused on relevant code, especially during build phases. (`implementation.md` - VII.A)

### 5. Transition to TDD Lab (5 mins)
- The techniques discussed set the stage for rigorous validation.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) provides the strongest framework for implementing with precision on the Right Side of the spectrum.
- Preview the TDD Lab: You'll write the tests (the specification), and use AI to make them pass.

## Speaker Notes / Presentation Flow

**Slide Proposal:**

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Text:** Day 3: The Clarity Spectrum in Action - Building & Validating
*   **Things to Say:** "Welcome to Day 3: Build! Yesterday we focused on planning and moving into the middle of the Clarity Spectrum. Today, we shift gears to the Right Side – taking our well-defined plans and tasks and turning them into working, validated code with AI assistance."

**Slide 2: Recap: The Clarity Spectrum & Today's Focus**
*   **Text:** (Show Spectrum Diagram)
    *   Day 1: Left Side (Discover)
    *   Day 2: Middle (Plan)
    *   Day 3 Focus: **Right Side (Build/Implement)** - Requirements are clear!
*   **Things to Say:** "Quick recap of our spectrum: Day 1 was exploration on the Left Side, Day 2 was planning and structuring in the Middle. Today is all about the Right Side: Implementation Clarity. We assume we have clear requirements, well-defined tasks (from Day 2), and now our goal is precise execution."

**Slide 3: Why Precision Matters on the Right Side**
*   **Text:**
    *   Goal: Minimize ambiguity for AI.
    *   Reduced Tolerance for Hallucinations (Errors = Bugs!).
    *   AI Amplifies *Your* Clarity (Precise inputs -> Precise outputs).
    *   Efficiency: Less back-and-forth when instructions are clear.
*   **Things to Say:** "On the Right Side, precision is paramount. Our goal is to give the AI unambiguous instructions. Unlike the Left Side where a hallucination might spark an idea, here, a hallucination or error in generated code is simply a bug. We have a much lower tolerance for errors."
*   **Things to Say:** "Remember, AI amplifies *your* clarity. If you provide precise, clear inputs (like a well-defined task and focused context), you're much more likely to get precise, correct code output. Vague inputs lead to vague or wrong code. Being precise also increases efficiency – less time spent correcting the AI."

**Slide 4: Model Choice for Implementation (Build Phase)**
*   **Text:** Consider models strong in coding & instruction following:
    *   *Primary Choices:* Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Std).
    *   *Strong Alternatives:* Gemini 2.5 Pro (exp), specific OpenAI o-series (w/ context).
    *   *Planning Models (Less Ideal Here):* May be overkill/less stable for direct code gen.
    *   *Key:* Experiment, but lean towards reliable code generators for BUILD.
*   **Things to Say:** "When we're focused purely on implementation based on clear tasks (Right Side), we might lean towards models known for strong coding performance and reliably following instructions. Based on benchmarks and our internal experience [ref `implementation.md`], Claude 3.7 Sonnet standard is often a good primary choice."
*   **Things to Say:** "Strong alternatives include Gemini 2.5 Pro or certain specialized OpenAI models if given good context. Models that excel primarily at complex reasoning might be less suitable or stable for direct, precise code generation compared to those optimized for coding tasks. The key, as always, is to experiment, but for this BUILD phase, prioritize reliable code output."

**Slide 5: Key BUILD Technique 1: Focused Context**
*   **Text:** (`implementation.md` - III.C, VII.C)
    *   Shift from broad (`@Codebase`) -> specific (`@file`, `@symbol`, `@Doc`, `@Rule`).
    *   Provide *only* what's needed for the task.
*   **Things to Say:** "Just as our mindset shifts, so does our context strategy. For implementation, move away from broad context like `@Codebase`. Instead, provide *focused* context using specific `@file`s, `@symbol`s for the function you're working on, relevant `@Doc`s for library usage, or applicable `@Rule`s. Give the AI *only* the information directly needed to complete the current, specific task."

**Slide 6: Demo: Focused Context**
*   **Text:** (Live Demo)
    *   Contrast vague prompt (less context) vs. focused prompt (`@file`, `@symbol`) for implementing a simple function.
*   **Things to Say:** "Let's imagine implementing a function. A vague prompt might just say 'Implement the calculate function'. A focused prompt would say 'Implement the `calculate_total` function in @logic.py, considering the arguments defined in @symbol:calculate_total and the requirements in @task123.md'. The second prompt provides much clearer, focused context, leading to better results." [Show comparison if possible].

**Slide 7: Key BUILD Technique 2: Small Incremental Steps**
*   **Text:** (`implementation.md` - IV.B)
    *   Implement tasks chunk-by-chunk (function-by-function, test-by-test).
    *   Easier to review, debug, keep AI focused.
    *   Limits blast radius of errors.
*   **Things to Say:** "Break down the implementation into small, incremental steps. Don't ask the AI to implement an entire feature in one go. Work function by function, or even test case by test case if using TDD. This makes the AI's output much easier to review and debug. It keeps the AI focused on a smaller problem and limits the 'blast radius' if it does make a mistake."

**Slide 8: Key BUILD Technique 3: Diligent Review & Validation**
*   **Text:** (`implementation.md` - IV.A)
    *   **NEVER blindly accept AI code.** (Treat as junior dev code review).
    *   **Diff Review:** Check additions *and deletions* carefully.
    *   **Ask for Reasoning:** "Explain this code", "Why this approach?" (`implementation.md` - IV.A).
    *   Connect to TDD: Tests = Ultimate validation.
*   **Things to Say:** "This is critical on the Right Side: **Never blindly accept AI-generated code.** Treat every suggestion like a code review from a junior developer – it might be right, but it needs verification. Carefully review the diffs – check not just what was added, but also what might have been deleted."
*   **Things to Say:** "Don't hesitate to ask the AI *why* it did something. 'Explain the logic here' or 'Why did you choose this approach instead of X?'. This can help uncover flawed reasoning. And as we'll see shortly, Test-Driven Development provides the ultimate automated validation for the code AI generates."

**Slide 9: Context Hygiene for BUILD**
*   **Text:** (`paymentsaijam.md` - Context Shedding, `implementation.md` - V.A, VIII.A)
    *   **Shed Planning Context:** Start NEW chats/sessions for implementation tasks.
    *   **Why:** Avoid polluted context, old assumptions, context limits.
    *   Practical Tip: Name chats clearly ("Implement Task #123").
    *   `.cursorignore`: Keep AI focused on relevant code (`implementation.md` - VII.A).
*   **Things to Say:** "Related to focused context is 'context hygiene'. When you shift from planning (Middle) to implementation (Right), **start new chat sessions.** Don't carry over the long, potentially broad conversation history from your planning discussions."
*   **Things to Say:** "Why? This prevents the AI from getting confused by outdated assumptions or discussions from the planning phase, avoids exceeding context limits, and keeps the AI focused purely on the implementation task at hand. Name your chats clearly, like 'Implement Task 123' or 'Debug Login Error'. And remember to use `.cursorignore` to exclude irrelevant directories or files from the AI's view."

**Slide 10: Transition to TDD Lab**
*   **Text:**
    *   Build techniques set stage for validation.
    *   TDD = Strongest framework for Right Side precision.
    *   Next: TDD Lab - Write tests, AI implements!
*   **Things to Say:** "These techniques – focused context, small steps, diligent review, context hygiene – all set the stage for rigorous validation during the build phase. The strongest framework we have for this, especially when working with AI, is Test-Driven Development."
*   **Things to Say:** "In the upcoming lab, we'll put this into practice. You'll define the specification by writing tests first, and then use AI to generate the implementation code needed to make those tests pass. Let's dive into TDD with AI."
