# Day 3 Talk: Preparing to Share: Becoming an AI Torchbearer

**Duration:** 30 mins

**Goal:** Equip participants with context, resources, and strategies to effectively share their bootcamp learnings with their teams, fulfilling the "Teach One, Train Many" objective from the `proposal.md`.

**Format:** Short Presentation, Discussion, Q&A

## Content Outline

### 1. The "Teach One, Train Many" Mission (5 mins)
- Reiterate the strategic goal from the `proposal.md`: You are the "Culture Drivers" and now **AI Torchbearers**.
- Why it matters: Scaling AI adoption, consistent practices, amplifying productivity gains across the org.
- Your role: Share knowledge, demonstrate value, encourage experimentation within your teams.

### 2. Resources Available to You (5 mins)
- Briefly walk through the key resources mentioned in `post_bootcamp.md` designed to help you share:
    - **Condensed Slide Decks:** Highlighting key concepts (Clarity Spectrum, Prompting, TDD, etc.).
    *   **Key Techniques Summary / Cheatsheet:** Quick reference guide.
    *   **Suggested Micro-Workshop Outline:** A template for a short team session.
    *   **FAQs Document:** Answers to common questions.
    *   **Your Own Prompt Logs:** Your personal examples are powerful!
    *   **Bootcamp Materials:** Full slides, curriculum docs for deeper dives.
- Point participants to the links in `post_bootcamp.md`.

### 3. Simple Strategies for Sharing (10 mins)
- **Don't try to replicate the whole bootcamp!** Focus on high-impact techniques.
- **Suggestion 1: Demo the Navigator Pattern:**
    - Pick a piece of *your team's code* that might be unfamiliar to some.
    - Run through 2-3 Navigator questions live, showing how AI helps build understanding quickly.
    - Easy to demo, high immediate value.
- **Suggestion 2: Show the AI-TDD Loop:**
    - Prepare a simple failing test.
    - Demo writing a skeleton and prompting AI to make the test pass.
    - Highlights AI for implementation + validation.
- **Suggestion 3: Share Key Prompting Tips:**
    - Pick 2-3 key tips from Day 1 (e.g., Specificity, Role Prompting, Providing Examples).
    - Show before/after examples of prompts for a common task.
- **Suggestion 4: Lead a "Clarity Spectrum" Discussion:**
    - Introduce the spectrum concept.
    - Discuss how the team might use AI differently for exploration vs. implementation tasks.
- **Key Point:** Tailor the sharing to your team's needs and current AI usage level.

### 4. Open Discussion & Q&A (10 mins)
- Facilitate a brief discussion:
    - "What challenges do you anticipate when sharing this with your team?"
    - "Which technique are you most excited to demo?"
    - "What other support would be helpful?"
- Answer questions about resources, strategies, or managing expectations.
