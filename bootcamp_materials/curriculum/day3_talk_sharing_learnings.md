## Content Outline

### 1. The "Teach One, Train Many" Mission (5 mins)
- Reiterate the strategic goal from the `proposal.md`: You are the "Culture Drivers" and now **AI Torchbearers**.
- Why it matters: Scaling AI adoption, consistent practices, amplifying productivity gains across the org.
- Your role: Share knowledge, demonstrate value, encourage experimentation within your teams.

### 2. Resources Available to You (5 mins)
- Briefly walk through the key resources mentioned in `post_bootcamp.md` designed to help you share:
    - **Condensed Slide Decks:** Highlighting key concepts (Clarity Spectrum, Prompting, TDD, etc.).
    *   **Key Techniques Summary / Cheatsheet:** Quick reference guide.
    *   **Suggested Micro-Workshop Outline:** A template for a short team session.
    *   **FAQs Document:** Answers to common questions.
    *   **Your Own Prompt Logs:** Your personal examples are powerful!
    *   **Bootcamp Materials:** Full slides, curriculum docs for deeper dives.
- Point participants to the links in `post_bootcamp.md`.

### 3. Simple Strategies for Sharing (10 mins)
- **Don't try to replicate the whole bootcamp!** Focus on high-impact techniques.
- **Suggestion 1: Demo the Navigator Pattern:**
    - Pick a piece of *your team's code* that might be unfamiliar to some.
    - Run through 2-3 Navigator questions live, showing how AI helps build understanding quickly.
    - Easy to demo, high immediate value.
- **Suggestion 2: Show the AI-TDD Loop:**
    - Prepare a simple failing test.
    - Demo writing a skeleton and prompting AI to make the test pass.
    - Highlights AI for implementation + validation.
- **Suggestion 3: Share Key Prompting Tips:**
    - Pick 2-3 key tips from Day 1 (e.g., Specificity, Role Prompting, Providing Examples).
    - Show before/after examples of prompts for a common task.
- **Suggestion 4: Lead a "Clarity Spectrum" Discussion:**
    - Introduce the spectrum concept.
    - Discuss how the team might use AI differently for exploration vs. implementation tasks.
- **Key Point:** Tailor the sharing to your team's needs and current AI usage level.

### 4. Open Discussion & Q&A (10 mins)
- Facilitate a brief discussion:
    - "What challenges do you anticipate when sharing this with your team?"
    - "Which technique are you most excited to demo?"
    - "What other support would be helpful?"
- Answer questions about resources, strategies, or managing expectations.

## Speaker Notes / Presentation Flow

**Slide Proposal:**

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Text:** Preparing to Share: Becoming an AI Torchbearer
*   **Things to Say:** "As we wrap up the final day of building and intense learning, let's shift our focus slightly. A core goal of this bootcamp, as outlined in the original proposal (`proposal.md`), isn't just for *you* to become proficient, but for you to help your *teams* adopt these tools and workflows. This session is about preparing you to become AI Torchbearers."

**Slide 2: The Goal: Teach One, Train Many**
*   **Text:** (`proposal.md` reference)
    *   Bootcamp Goal: Empower individuals AND enable team adoption.
    *   Your Role: Share knowledge, demo key techniques, champion effective use.
    *   Impact: Scale productivity gains beyond this room.
*   **Things to Say:** "Remember the 'Teach One, Train Many' concept from the bootcamp proposal? The idea is that by empowering each of you, we create catalysts within teams to drive broader adoption and ultimately scale the productivity benefits of AI across the engineering organization. Your role moving forward is crucial – sharing what you've learned, demoing techniques, and championing effective AI use within your teams."

**Slide 3: Post-Bootcamp Resources (`post_bootcamp.md`)**
*   **Text:**
    *   Reviewing the Post-Bootcamp Guide (`post_bootcamp.md`)
    *   Key Sections:
        *   Action Items (Apply, Share, Plan)
        *   Links to Bootcamp Materials (Slides, Curriculum, Handouts)
        *   **"Train Many" Materials (Condensed slides, Cheatsheet, Micro-Workshop)**
        *   Support Channels (Slack, Hub)
*   **Things to Say:** "To support you in this, we've prepared a Post-Bootcamp Guide, which you can find at `bootcamp_materials/post_bootcamp.md`. [Briefly show or navigate to the file if possible]. This guide outlines suggested action items for you, provides links back to all the bootcamp materials we've used, and most importantly, includes specific 'Train Many' resources designed to help you share this knowledge."
*   **Things to Say:** "These 'Train Many' materials include things like a condensed version of the key slides, the technique cheatsheets you have, and even a suggested outline for a short micro-workshop you could run with your team."

**Slide 4: Strategies for Sharing & Demoing**
*   **Text:** How to Effectively Share:
    *   **Focus on Workflow, Not Just Features:** Show the *process* (Clarity Spectrum -> Technique -> Validation).
    *   **Demo Key Techniques:** Choose 1-2 high-impact workflows:
        *   Navigator Pattern (Understanding code).
        *   AI-Driven Planning -> Task Generation.
        *   TDD with AI (Implementing a small function).
    *   **Keep it Concise:** Aim for short, impactful demos (e.g., team meeting segment).
    *   **Be Honest About Limitations:** Manage expectations (Context, Verification!).
    *   **Use the Provided Materials:** Adapt the micro-workshop outline/slides.
*   **Things to Say:** "When you go back to your teams, how can you share this effectively? Focus on demonstrating a *workflow*, not just isolated features. Show how you move along the Clarity Spectrum, choose an appropriate technique, use AI, and *validate* the result. That's more impactful than just showing a cool code generation trick."
*   **Things to Say:** "Choose one or two high-impact techniques to demo initially. Maybe the Navigator Pattern for understanding unfamiliar code, or the flow from planning to task generation, or a simple TDD cycle with AI. Keep your demos concise – perhaps a segment in a team meeting rather than a long presentation. Use the 'Train Many' materials as a starting point."
*   **Things to Say:** "Crucially, be honest about the limitations. Manage your team's expectations. Emphasize the need for careful context management, diligent verification, and the fact that AI isn't perfect."

**Slide 5: Overcoming Potential Hesitancy**
*   **Text:** Addressing Team Questions:
    *   *"Is it magic?"* -> Explain limitations, need for verification.
    *   *"Is it safe/secure?"* -> Discuss Privacy Mode, `.cursorignore`, Rule review.
    *   *"Will it take my job?"* -> Frame as augmentation, frees up time for higher-level problems.
    *   *"Is it reliable?"* -> Stress validation, TDD, iterative approach.
*   **Things to Say:** "You might encounter some skepticism or questions from your team. Be prepared to address them. If someone thinks it's magic, emphasize the limitations and the absolute need for human verification. If they ask about security, talk about Privacy Mode, `.cursorignore`, and the importance of reviewing things like shared Rules. If the 'job replacement' question comes up, frame AI as an augmentation tool that handles tedious tasks, freeing *us* up for more complex problem-solving. If they question reliability, stress the workflows we learned – validation, TDD, and the iterative process."

**Slide 6: Q&A on Sharing & Driving Adoption**
*   **Text:** Q&A
*   **Things to Say:** "We have some time now for Q&A specifically focused on how you can share these learnings and help drive adoption within your own teams. What questions or concerns do you have about becoming an AI Torchbearer?"

**Slide 7: Transition to Final Wrap-up**
*   **Text:** Next: Final Survey, Certificates & Wrap-up
*   **Things to Say:** "Great discussion. Sharing this knowledge is key to maximizing the impact of this bootcamp. Now, let's move into our final session for the overall bootcamp wrap-up, certificates, and the final feedback survey."
