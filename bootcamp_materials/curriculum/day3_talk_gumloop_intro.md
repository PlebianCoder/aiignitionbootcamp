## Potential Content Outline (TBC)

### 1. Introduction to Gumloop (10 mins)
    *   What is Gumloop? Core value proposition for engineering teams using AI.
    *   High-level overview of its features and capabilities.
    *   How does it complement tools like Cursor?

### 2. Potential Use Case 1: Advanced Agent Orchestration (15 mins)
    *   (If applicable) How Gumloop might help manage more complex agent sequences than basic task files.
    *   Handling dependencies, parallel execution, more robust error handling in agent workflows?
    *   Demo: Showcase a relevant agent orchestration feature.

### 3. Potential Use Case 2: Workflow Automation Beyond IDE (10 mins)
    *   (If applicable) Automating tasks that span multiple tools or stages (e.g., JIRA -> Planning -> Coding -> Testing -> Deployment).
    *   Integrating AI actions into broader CI/CD or development pipelines.
    *   Demo: Showcase a relevant cross-tool workflow automation.

### 4. Potential Use Case 3: Measurement & Observability (10 mins)
    *   (If applicable) How Gumloop might provide insights into AI tool usage, effectiveness, or cost.
    *   Connecting to bootcamp measurement goals (`proposal.md`).
    *   Dashboards, metrics, or analysis capabilities.
    *   Demo: Showcase relevant measurement features.

### 5. Integration & Next Steps (5 mins)
    *   How can engineers start experimenting with Gumloop (if available)?
    *   Where to find more information or support.
    *   Q&A.
