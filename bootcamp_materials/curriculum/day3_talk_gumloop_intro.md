## Speaker Notes / Presentation Flow (TBC - Based on Potential Outline)

**Slide Proposal:**

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Text:** Intro to Gumloop: Automating & Measuring AI Workflows (Content TBC)
*   **Things to Say:** "For this next session, we have a special guest [or Introduction] to talk about Gumloop. [Introduce Speaker/Topic]. The specifics are still being finalized based on [Speaker]'s expertise and focus, but we expect to cover how tools like Gumloop might fit into the broader AI-driven development landscape." *(Adjust based on whether it's a guest speaker or internal lead)*

**Slide 2: Introduction to Gumloop (Potential Content)**
*   **Text:**
    *   What is Gumloop? Core value proposition for Eng Teams.
    *   High-level features/capabilities.
    *   Complementary to IDE tools like Cursor?
*   **Things to Say (Presenter to fill in):** "[Presenter explains Gumloop's core concept, target audience (engineering teams using AI), and main goals. Briefly touches on key features and how it aims to solve problems beyond what a typical IDE copilot does. Explains the relationship/synergy with tools like Cursor.]"

**Slide 3: Potential Use Case 1: Advanced Agent Orchestration (If Applicable)**
*   **Text:**
    *   Managing complex agent sequences (Beyond basic task files).
    *   Handling dependencies, parallelism, robust error handling?
    *   (Demo: Relevant orchestration feature)
*   **Things to Say (Presenter to fill in):** "[If Gumloop focuses on this: Presenter discusses how Gumloop might enable more sophisticated agent workflows than simple sequential task lists. This could involve managing dependencies between tasks, running steps in parallel, or providing more advanced error handling and retry logic for agent actions. A demo would showcase this specific capability.]"

**Slide 4: Potential Use Case 2: Workflow Automation Beyond IDE (If Applicable)**
*   **Text:**
    *   Automating tasks spanning multiple tools/stages (JIRA -> Plan -> Code -> Test -> Deploy).
    *   Integrating AI actions into broader CI/CD or Dev pipelines.
    *   (Demo: Relevant cross-tool workflow)
*   **Things to Say (Presenter to fill in):** "[If Gumloop focuses on this: Presenter explains how Gumloop might automate workflows that extend beyond the IDE. Examples could include triggering AI planning based on a new JIRA ticket, integrating AI-driven code generation into CI/CD, or automating steps across different development tools. A demo would illustrate such a cross-tool workflow.]"

**Slide 5: Potential Use Case 3: Measurement & Observability (If Applicable)**
*   **Text:**
    *   Providing insights into AI tool usage, effectiveness, cost.
    *   Connecting to bootcamp measurement goals (`proposal.md`).
    *   Dashboards, metrics, analysis capabilities?
    *   (Demo: Relevant measurement features)
*   **Things to Say (Presenter to fill in):** "[If Gumloop focuses on this: Presenter discusses how Gumloop might help measure and observe AI usage within engineering teams. This could involve tracking tool usage, cost attribution, identifying effective AI patterns, or providing dashboards/metrics relevant to the bootcamp's measurement goals. A demo would showcase these analytics or observability features.]"

**Slide 6: Integration & Next Steps**
*   **Text:**
    *   How can engineers start experimenting (if available)?
    *   Where to find more info/support?
    *   Q&A.
