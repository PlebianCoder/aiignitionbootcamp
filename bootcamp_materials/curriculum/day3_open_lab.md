# Day 3: Open Lab / Project Work / Advanced Practice

**Duration:** 210 mins (3.5 hours)

**Goal:** Provide extended dedicated time for participants to synthesize and apply concepts from all three days (Discover, Plan, Build) to their own work or explore advanced techniques, consciously choosing approaches based on the Clarity Spectrum.

**Format:** Self-directed Work, TA Support

---

## Activities

Participants choose **one** path, focusing on applying learned techniques:

1.  **Apply to Real Work (Backlog Item):**
    *   Work on the **Backlog Item/Problem you brought (BYOP)**.
    *   **Identify Clarity:** Where does this task fall on the Spectrum? (Discovery? Planning? Implementation?)
    *   **Select Techniques:** Choose appropriate AI methods based on the Spectrum position:
        *   *Left Side (Uncertainty):* Navigator Pattern (Day 1), Code Explanation, Documentation Generation (Day 1).
        *   *Middle (Emerging):* AI-driven Planning, Task Decomposition, Context Gathering (@symbols, Rules) (Day 2).
        *   *Right Side (Clarity):* TDD with AI, Focused Implementation Prompts, Debugging Techniques, Agent Execution (Day 3).
    *   **Execute:** Work on the task using AI, focusing on process (prompts, validation, context hygiene).
        *   **Debugging Practice:** If encountering errors (AI-generated or otherwise), consciously apply techniques from the "Debugging When AI Goes Wrong" talk (Logs, Explicit Feedback, Reversion, Backtracking).
        *   **Agent Practice (Optional):** If working on a suitable, well-defined task from your `tasks.md`, consider using Agent Mode for implementation. Remember to review the plan, monitor execution, and validate results carefully.
    *   **Log:** Record prompts, results, and reflections on technique effectiveness.

2.  **Work on Provided Fallback Task:**
    *   Focus on the **provided Payments/Commerce Platform task**.
    *   Identify Clarity, Select Techniques, Execute, and Log as described in Path 1.

3.  **Tackle Lab Stretch Goals:**
    *   Revisit previous labs (Day 1-3) and attempt stretch goals (e.g., complex refactoring, full service mapping, advanced agent sequences, more comprehensive test generation) **using either your BYOP context or the fallback task context**.
    *   Focus on refining prompts and workflows learned.

4.  **Experiment with Advanced Concepts:**
    *   **Agent Workflows:** Try setting up a basic `@tasks.md` workflow for the Agent **and execute one simple task**, focusing on observation and validation.
    *   **Rule Writing:** Experiment with writing a simple Project Rule (`.cursor/rules`) for a common pattern in their codebase.
    *   **Model Comparison:** Try the *same* task (e.g., implementing a specific function, debugging a specific error) with different models (e.g., Claude Sonnet vs. Gemini Pro vs. GPT-4o) and compare results/speed/cost/reliability. Note findings in prompt log. (`implementation.md` - II, VIII.B)
    *   **Prompt Chaining:** Explore more complex multi-turn prompts where the output of one AI response becomes the input/context for the next.
    *   **Advanced Context:** Experiment with more complex uses of `@Git`/`@Recent Changes` or combining multiple context sources effectively.

## Support

*   TAs circulate to:
    *   Help participants choose appropriate tasks/techniques based on the Clarity Spectrum.
    *   Review prompts and AI interaction strategies.
    *   Troubleshoot tool issues or AI errors.
    *   Provide guidance on advanced concepts.

---

## Deliverable
*   Continued prompt log entries detailing the work done, techniques applied, and outcomes.
*   Self-assessment of progress on the chosen task/experiment.
*   Share one key learning or challenge from the open lab during the final wrap-up.
