## Session Flow

**1. Recap: The AI Ignition Journey (10 mins)**
    *   **Visual:** Display the Clarity Spectrum diagram.
    *   **Narrative:** Briefly walk through the 3-day arc:
        *   **Day 1 (Discover - Left Side):** Building intuition, understanding LLMs, navigating uncertainty with the Navigator Pattern, generating initial documentation.
        *   **Day 2 (Plan - Middle):** Moving to emerging clarity, using AI for structured planning, context gathering, decomposing work into shovel-ready tasks.
        *   **Day 3 (Build - Right Side):** Achieving implementation clarity, using TDD with AI for validation, debugging AI errors, automating with Agents.
    *   **Key Theme Reinforcement:** Emphasize that effectively using AI means matching your technique and expectations to your current position on the Clarity Spectrum.
    *   **Call to Action:** Stress that mastery comes from *continuous practice* and integrating these techniques into daily workflows (`paymentsaijam.md`).

**2. Next Steps & Resources Review (10 mins)**
    *   **Reference:** Briefly project or walk through key sections of the `[Post-Bootcamp Guide](./post_bootcamp.md)`.
    *   **Action Items Recap:** Quickly reiterate the immediate next steps expected of participants (Apply learnings, Complete survey, Share takeaways, Plan team share-out, Continue logging prompts).
    *   **Resource Highlights:** Point out the location of shared slides, the "Train Many" support materials (condensed decks, cheatsheet), and the Slack channels for continued support and learning (`#ai-ignition-bootcamp-learnings`, `#ask-ai-support`).
    *   **Reinforce "Teach One, Train Many":** Briefly remind them of their role as AI Torchbearers.

**3. Final Feedback Survey (5 mins)**
    *   **Importance:** Explain that feedback is crucial for iterating and improving future bootcamps.
    *   **Logistics:** Share the survey link (`[Link to Final Survey - Placeholder]`). Request participants to complete it now if possible, or shortly after.
    *   Mention the confidence delta questions related to the Clarity Spectrum.

**4. Certificate Distribution (Logistical Note - 2 mins)**
    *   Explain the process for receiving the "AI Copilot @ Instacart" digital certificate/badge (e.g., email delivery, platform notification).
    *   Congratulate participants on completing the intensive program.

**5. Closing Remarks & Thank You (3 mins)**
    *   Thank participants for their active engagement and contributions.
    *   Thank TAs and organizing staff.
    *   Express excitement about seeing how they apply their learnings and drive AI adoption.
    *   Final encouragement to keep experimenting and sharing.
