# Day 2: Workshop Share-out & Reflection

**Duration:** 30 mins

**Goal:** Allow participants to share experiences from the planning workshop, discuss challenges and successes in using AI for planning/task generation, and reflect on moving across the Clarity Spectrum.

**Format:** Facilitated Group Discussion / Share-out

---

## Session Flow

**1. Setting the Stage (2 mins)**
    *   Briefly explain the purpose: Share learnings, challenges, and interesting observations from the AI Planning Workflow workshop.
    *   Encourage concise sharing to allow multiple people/pods to contribute.

**2. Pod/Individual Share-out (15-20 mins)**
    *   **Facilitation:** Ask for volunteers or call on pods/individuals to briefly share:
        *   "What feature/problem did you plan?"
        *   "What was one success or helpful technique you used when generating the plan or tasks with AI?" (e.g., a specific prompt, context strategy, use of rules/templates)
        *   "What was the biggest challenge you faced?" (e.g., getting specific tasks, managing context, AI hallucinations/errors)
    *   **Moderation:** Keep sharing focused and manage time. Encourage questions between participants if time allows.

**3. Guided Reflection & Discussion (5-10 mins)**
    *   **Facilitation:** Use the reflection questions from the workshop (`day2_workshop_planning_workflow.md`) to guide a broader discussion:
        *   "How did providing specific context (@symbols, rules) impact the quality compared to less specific prompts? Any concrete examples?"
        *   "Where did you feel the shift from 'Emerging Clarity' towards 'Implementation Clarity' most strongly? Was it during plan refinement or task generation?"
        *   "What makes a task truly 'shovel-ready' in your view, especially when preparing for AI implementation (Day 3)? How much manual refinement was needed?"
    *   Connect participant experiences back to the concepts of context management, prompt specificity, iterative refinement, and the Clarity Spectrum.

**4. Transition to Wrap-up (1 min)**
    *   Thank participants for sharing.
    *   Transition smoothly into the final Day 2 wrap-up session.
