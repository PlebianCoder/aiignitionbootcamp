## Session Flow

**1. Recap of Day 1: Discover (5 mins)**
    *   Briefly reiterate the key topics covered:
        *   LLM Foundations (Tokens, Context, Prediction, Sampling)
        *   Model Characteristics
        *   Effective Prompting Strategies
        *   Navigator Pattern for Code Understanding
        *   AI for Documentation
    *   Mention the overarching theme: Operating on the Left Side (Uncertainty) of the Clarity Spectrum.

**2. Structured Reflection (10-15 mins)**
    *   **Facilitation:** Lead a discussion using the reflection questions posed in the last workshop (`day1_workshop_map_service.md`) and potentially others:
        *   "Where did you feel most uncertain (Left Side) today? When exploring the code or prompting the AI?"
        *   "Share one surprising AI response you encountered (good or bad). What did you learn from it?"
        *   "How did verifying AI output against the actual code impact your process or understanding?"
        *   "What's one prompting technique you found immediately useful?"
    *   Encourage participants to share insights or challenges.
    *   Relate observations back to the Clarity Spectrum and the importance of validation.

**3. Prompt Logging Reminder (2 mins)**
    *   Remind participants about the importance of maintaining their Prompt Log for personal reference and identifying effective patterns.

**4. Day 1 Survey Administration (5 mins)**
    *   Share the link to the Day 1 feedback survey (`[Link to Day 1 Survey - Placeholder]`).
    *   Explain its purpose (quick feedback, confidence check).
    *   Ask participants to complete it before leaving or first thing Day 2.

**5. Preview Day 2: Plan (3 mins)**
    *   Briefly introduce the theme for Day 2: Moving towards the Middle of the Clarity Spectrum - Planning & Design.
    *   Mention key topics: AI-driven planning, context management (Rules, @-symbols), generating tasks.
    *   Confirm start time for Day 2.
