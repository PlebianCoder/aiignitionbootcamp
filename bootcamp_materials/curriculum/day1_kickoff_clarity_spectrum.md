# Day 1: Kickoff & The Clarity Spectrum

**Type:** Introduction / Framing

**Time:** 10:00 a.m.â€“10:30 a.m. (30 mins)

**Goal:** Welcome participants, set the stage for the bootcamp, introduce the core themes, and frame AI interaction using the 'Clarity Spectrum'.

**Materials:** Welcome slides, Icebreaker question

**Activities & Talking Points:**

1.  **Welcome & Introductions (5 mins - Leads):**
    *   Welcome message, express excitement.
    *   Briefly introduce Bootcamp Leads & TAs (names, maybe one fun fact).
    *   Acknowledge diverse backgrounds, emphasize collaborative learning environment.
2.  **Bootcamp Overview (5 mins - Leads):**
    *   High-level goal: Supercharge development workflows with AI.
    *   Briefly outline the 3-day structure:
        *   Day 1 (Discover): LLM Fundamentals, Understanding Code
        *   Day 2 (Plan): Structured Planning & Design with AI
        *   Day 3 (Build): Code Generation, Debugging, Agents
    *   Mention logistics: Schedule overview, breaks, lunch, support channels (Slack, dedicated TA help).
3.  **Icebreaker (5 mins - Leads/All):**
    *   Example: "Share your name, team, and one thing you hope to learn or one task you hope AI can help with."
    *   Quick round-robin introductions.
4.  **Introducing the Clarity Spectrum (10 mins - Leads):**
    *   **Concept:** Frame AI (like Cursor) as a powerful tool, but not magic. Its effectiveness depends on *how* we use it and for *what kind of task*. (This framework emerged from internal experiences like the "Payments AI Jam" - `@paymentsaijam.md`).
    *   **Analogy:** Think of it like different tools for building a house (hammer vs. blueprint software vs. brainstorming whiteboard).
    *   **Visual:** (If possible, use a slide with a left-to-right spectrum).
    *   **Left Side (Low Clarity / Fuzzy / Exploration):**
        *   *Goal:* Exploring ideas, understanding complex/unknown systems, asking open-ended questions.
        *   *Examples:* "Brainstorm potential solutions for X", "Explain this unfamiliar codebase", "What are the pros and cons of approach Y?", "Identify potential edge cases."
        *   *AI Role:* Brainstorming partner, Socratic questioner, code summarizer.
    *   **Middle (Medium Clarity / Design / Structuring):**
        *   *Goal:* Drafting outlines, creating initial structures, identifying unknowns based on partial info.
        *   *Examples:* "Draft an outline for function X", "Suggest a basic API structure for Y", "List the steps needed to implement Z", "Generate a rough ERD based on these requirements."
        *   *AI Role:* Draftsman, outliner, co-designer.
    *   **Right Side (High Clarity / Defined / Execution):**
        *   *Goal:* Implementing specific logic, fixing known bugs, refactoring to standards, generating boilerplate based on clear instructions.
        *   *Examples:* "Implement function X according to this spec", "Fix this specific lint error", "Refactor this code to use async/await", "Generate unit tests for this function."
        *   *AI Role:* Code generator, Linter/Fixer, Refactoring tool.
    *   **Key Takeaway:** Matching your prompt and expectations to the task's clarity level leads to better results. Don't expect perfect code (Right Side) from a vague exploration prompt (Left Side). We'll see this spectrum in action today when we explore code (Navigator Pattern) and generate documentation.
5.  **Setting Expectations (5 mins - Leads):**
    *   Focus on hands-on practice.
    *   Encourage questions and collaboration.
    *   Mention prompt logging importance.
    *   Reiterate support channels.
